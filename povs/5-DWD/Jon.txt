the white wolf raced through a black wood, beneath a pale cliff as tall as the sky. the moon ran with him, slipping through a tangle of bare branches overhead, across the starry sky. snow, the moon murmured. the wolf made no answer. snow crunched beneath his paws. the wind sighed through the trees. far off, he could hear his packmates calling to him, like to like. they were hunting too. a wild rain lashed down upon his black brother as he tore at the flesh of an enormous goat, washing the blood from his side where the goat's long horn had raked him. in another place, his little sister lifted her head to sing to the moon, and a hundred small grey cousins broke off their hunt to sing with her. the hills were warmer where they were, and full of food. many a night his sister's pack gorged on the flesh of sheep and cows and horses, the prey of men, and sometimes even on the flesh of man himself. snow, the moon called down again, cackling. the white wolf padded along the man trail beneath the icy cliff. the taste of blood was on his tongue, and his ears rang to the song of the hundred cousins. once they had been six, five whimpering blind in the snow beside their dead mother, sucking cool milk from her hard dead nipples whilst he crawled off alone. four remained ... and one the white wolf could no longer sense. snow, the moon insisted. the white wolf ran from it, racing toward the cave of night where the sun had hidden, his breath frosting in the air. on starless nights the great cliff was as black as stone, a darkness towering high above the wide world, but when the moon came out it shimmered pale and icy as a frozen stream. the wolf's pelt was thick and shaggy, but when the wind blew along the ice no fur could keep the chill out. on the other side the wind was colder still, the wolf sensed. that was where his brother was, the grey brother who smelled of summer. snow. an icicle tumbled from a branch. the white wolf turned and bared his teeth. snow! his fur rose bristling, as the woods dissolved around him. snow, snow, snow! he heard the beat of wings. through the gloom a raven flew. it landed on jon snow's chest with a thump and a scrabbling of claws. snow! it screamed into his face. i hear you. the room was dim, his pallet hard. grey light leaked through the shutters, promising another bleak cold day. is this how you woke mormont? get your feathers out of my face. jon wriggled an arm out from under his blankets to shoo the raven off. it was a big bird, old and bold and scruffy, utterly without fear. snow, it cried, flapping to his bedpost. snow, snow. jon filled his fist with a pillow and let fly, but the bird took to the air. the pillow struck the wall and burst, scattering stuffing everywhere just as dolorous edd tollett poked his head through the door. beg pardon, he said, ignoring the flurry of feathers, shall i fetch m'lord some breakfast? corn, cried the raven. corn, corn. roast raven, jon suggested. and half a pint of ale. having a steward fetch and serve for him still felt strange; not long ago, it would have been him fetching breakfast for lord commander mormont. three corns and one roast raven, said dolorous edd. very good, m'lord, only hobb's made boiled eggs, black sausage, and apples stewed with prunes. the apples stewed with prunes are excellent, except for the prunes. i won't eat prunes myself. well, there was one time when hobb chopped them up with chestnuts and carrots and hid them in a hen. never trust a cook, my lord. they'll prune you when you least expect it. later. breakfast could wait; stannis could not. any trouble from the stockades last night? not since you put guards on the guards, m'lord. good. a thousand wildlings had been penned up beyond the wall, the captives stannis baratheon had taken when his knights had smashed mance rayder's patchwork host. many of the prisoners were women, and some of the guards had been sneaking them out to warm their beds. king's men, queen's men, it did not seem to matter; a few black brothers had tried the same thing. men were men, and these were the only women for a thousand leagues. two more wildlings turned up to surrender, edd went on. a mother with a girl clinging to her skirts. she had a boy babe too, all swaddled up in fur, but he was dead. dead, said the raven. it was one of the bird's favorite words. dead, dead, dead. they had free folk drifting in most every night, starved half-frozen creatures who had run from the battle beneath the wall only to crawl back when they realized there was no safe place to run to. was the mother questioned? jon asked. stannis baratheon had smashed mance rayder's host and made the king-beyond-the-wall his captive ... but the wildlings were still out there, the weeper and tormund giantsbane and thousands more. aye, m'lord, said edd, but all she knows is that she ran off during the battle and hid in the woods after. we filled her full of porridge, sent her to the pens, and burned the babe. burning dead children had ceased to trouble jon snow; live ones were another matter. two kings to wake the dragon. the father first and then the son, so both die kings. the words had been murmured by one of the queen's men as maester aemon had cleaned his wounds. jon had tried to dismiss them as his fever talking. aemon had demurred. there is power in a king's blood, the old maester had warned, and better men than stannis have done worse things than this. the king can be harsh and unforgiving, aye, but a babe still on the breast? only a monster would give a living child to the flames. jon pissed in darkness, filling his chamber pot as the old bear's raven muttered complaints. the wolf dreams had been growing stronger, and he found himself remembering them even when awake. ghost knows that grey wind is dead. robb had died at the twins, betrayed by men he'd believed his friends, and his wolf had perished with him. bran and rickon had been murdered too, beheaded at the behest of theon greyjoy, who had once been their lord father's ward ... but if dreams did not lie, their direwolves had escaped. at queenscrown, one had come out of the darkness to save jon's life. summer, it had to be. his fur was grey, and shaggydog is black. he wondered if some part of his dead brothers lived on inside their wolves. he filled his basin from the flagon of water beside his bed, washed his face and hands, donned a clean set of black woolens, laced up a black leather jerkin, and pulled on a pair of well-worn boots. mormont's raven watched with shrewd black eyes, then fluttered to the window. do you take me for your thrall? when jon folded back the window with its thick diamond-shaped panes of yellow glass, the chill of the morning hit him in the face. he took a breath to clear away the cobwebs of the night as the raven flapped away. that bird is too clever by half. it had been the old bear's companion for long years, but that had not stopped it from eating mormont's face once he died. outside his bedchamber a flight of steps descended to a larger room furnished with a scarred pinewood table and a dozen oak-and-leather chairs. with stannis in the king's tower and the lord commander's tower burned to a shell, jon had established himself in donal noye's modest rooms behind the armory. in time, no doubt, he would need larger quarters, but for the moment these would serve whilst he accustomed himself to command. the grant that the king had presented him for signature was on the table beneath a silver drinking cup that had once been donal noye's. the one-armed smith had left few personal effects: the cup, six pennies and a copper star, a niello brooch with a broken clasp, a musty brocade doublet that bore the stag of storm's end. his treasures were his tools, and the swords and knives he made. his life was at the forge. jon moved the cup aside and read the parchment once again. if i put my seal to this, i will forever be remembered as the lord commander who gave away the wall, he thought, but if i should refuse ... stannis baratheon was proving to be a prickly guest, and a restless one. he had ridden down the kingsroad almost as far as queenscrown, prowled through the empty hovels of mole's town, inspected the ruined forts at queensgate and oakenshield. each night he walked atop the wall with lady melisandre, and during the days he visited the stockades, picking captives out for the red woman to question. he does not like to be balked. this would not be a pleasant morning, jon feared. from the armory came a clatter of shields and swords, as the latest lot of boys and raw recruits armed themselves. he could hear the voice of iron emmett telling them to be quick about it. cotter pyke had not been pleased to lose him, but the young ranger had a gift for training men. he loves to fight, and he'll teach his boys to love it too. or so he hoped. jon's cloak hung on a peg by the door, his sword belt on another. he donned them both and made his way to the armory. the rug where ghost slept was empty, he saw. two guardsmen stood inside the doors, clad in black cloaks and iron halfhelms, spears in their hands. will m'lord be wanting a tail? asked garse. i think i can find the king's tower by myself. jon hated having guards trailing after him everywhere he went. it made him feel like a mother duck leading a procession of ducklings. iron emmett's lads were well at it in the yard, blunted swords slamming into shields and ringing against one another. jon stopped to watch a moment as horse pressed hop-robin back toward the well. horse had the makings of a good fighter, he decided. he was strong and getting stronger, and his instincts were sound. hop-robin was another tale. his clubfoot was bad enough, but he was afraid of getting hit as well. perhaps we can make a steward of him. the fight ended abruptly, with hop-robin on the ground. well fought, jon said to horse, but you drop your shield too low when pressing an attack. you will want to correct that, or it is like to get you killed. yes, m'lord. i'll keep it higher next time. horse pulled hop-robin to his feet, and the smaller boy made a clumsy bow. a few of stannis's knights were sparring on the far side of the yard. king's men in one corner and gueen's men in another, jon did not fail to note, but only a few. it's too cold for most of them. as he strode past them, a booming voice called after him. boy! you there! boy! boy was not the worst of the things that jon snow had been called since being chosen lord commander. he ignored it. snow, the voice insisted, lord commander. this time he stopped. ser? the knight overtopped him by six inches. a man who bears valyrian steel should use it for more than scratching his arse. jon had seen this one about the castle— a knight of great renown, to hear him tell it. during the battle beneath the wall, ser godry farring had slain a fleeing giant, pounding after him on horseback and driving a lance through his back, then dismounting to hack off the creature's pitiful small head. the queen's men had taken to calling him godry the giantslayer. jon remembered ygritte, crying. / am the last of the giants. i use longclaw when i must, ser. how well, though? ser godry drew his own blade. show us. i promise not to hurt you, lad. how kind of you. some other time, ser. i fear that i have other duties just now. you fear. i see that. ser godry grinned at his friends. he fears, he repeated, for the slow ones. you will excuse me. jon showed them his back. castle black seemed a bleak and forlorn place in the pale dawn light. my command, jon snow reflected ruefully, as much a ruin as it is a strong-hold. the lord commander's tower was a shell, the common hall a pile of blackened timbers, and hardin's tower looked as if the next gust of wind would knock it over ... though it had looked that way for years. behind them rose the wall: immense, forbidding, frigid, acrawl with builders pushing up a new switchback stair to join the remnants of the old. they worked from dawn to dusk. without the stair, there was no way to reach the top of the wall save by winch. that would not serve if the wildlings should attack again. above the king's tower the great golden battle standard of house baratheon cracked like a whip from the roof where jon snow had prowled with bow in hand not long ago, slaying thenns and free folk beside satin and deaf dick follard. two queen's men stood shivering on the steps, their hands tucked up into their armpits and their spears leaning against the door. those cloth gloves will never serve, jon told them. see bowen marsh on the morrow, and he'll give you each a pair of leather gloves lined with fur. we will, m'lord, and thank you, said the older guard. that's if our bloody hands aren't froze off, the younger added, his breath a pale mist. i used to think that it got cold up in the dornish marches. what did i know? nothing, thought jon snow, the same as me. halfway up the winding steps, he came upon samwell tarly, headed down. are you coming from the king? jon asked him. maester aemon sent me with a letter. i see. some lords trusted their maesters to read their letters and convey the contents, but stannis insisted on breaking the seals himself. how did stannis take it? not happily, by his face. sam dropped his voice to a whisper. i am not supposed to speak of then don't. jon wondered which of his father's bannermen had refused king stannis homage this time. he was quick enough to spread the word when karhold declared for him. how are you and your longbow getting on? i found a good book about archery. sam frowned. doing it is harder than reading about it, though. i get blisters. keep at it. we may need your bow on the wall if the others turn up some dark night. oh, i hope not. more guards stood outside the king's solar. no arms are allowed in his grace's presence, my lord, their serjeant said. i'll need that sword. your knives as well. it would do no good to protest, jon knew. he handed them his weaponry. within the solar the air was warm. lady melisandre was seated near the fire, her ruby glimmering against the pale skin of her throat. ygritte had been kissed by fire; the red priestess was fire, and her hair was blood and flame. stannis stood behind the rough-hewn table where the old bear had once been wont to sit and take his meals. covering the table was a large map of the north, painted on a ragged piece of hide. a tallow candle weighed down one end of it, a steel gauntlet the other. the king wore lambswool breeches and a quilted doublet, yet somehow he looked as stiff and uncomfortable as if he had been clad in plate and mail. his skin was pale leather, his beard cropped so short that it might have been painted on. a fringe about his temples was all that remained of his black hair. in his hand was a parchment with a broken seal of dark green wax. jon took a knee. the king frowned at him, and rattled the parchment angrily. rise. tell me, who is lyanna mormont? one of lady maege's daughters, sire. the youngest. she was named for my lord father's sister. to curry your lord father's favor, i don't doubt. i know how that game is played. how old is this wretched girl child? jon had to think a moment. ten. or near enough to make no matter. might i know how she has offended your grace? stannis read from the letter. bear island knows no king but the king in the north, whose name is stark. a girl often, you say, and she presumes to scold her lawful king. his close-cropped beard lay like a shadow over his hollow cheeks. see that you keep these tidings to yourself, lord snow. karhold is with me, that is all the men need know. i will not have your brothers trading tales of how this child spat on me. as you command, sire. maege mormont had ridden south with robb, jon knew. her eldest daughter had joined the young wolf's host as well. even if both of them had died, however, lady maege had other daughters, some with children of their own. had they gone with robb as well? surely lady maege would have left at least one of the older girls behind as castellan. he did not understand why lyanna should be writing stannis, and could not help but wonder if the girl's answer might have been different if the letter had been sealed with a direwolf instead of a crowned stag, and signed by jon stark, lord of winterfell. it is too late for such misgivings. you made your choice. two score ravens were sent out, the king complained, yet we get no response but silence and defiance. homage is the duty every leal subject owes his king. yet your father's bannermen all turn their back on me, save the karstarks. is arnolf karstark the only man of honor in the north? arnolf karstark was the late lord rickard's uncle. he had been made the castellan of karhold when his nephew and his sons went south with robb, and he had been the first to respond to king stannis's call for homage, with a raven declaring his allegiance. the karstarks have no other choice, jon might have said. rickard karstark had betrayed the direwolf and spilled the blood of lions. the stag was karhold's only hope. in times as confused as these, even men of honor must wonder where their duty lies. your grace is not the only king in the realm demanding homage. lady melisandre stirred. tell me, lord snow ... where were these other kings when the wild people stormed your wall? a thousand leagues away and deaf to our need, jon replied. i have not forgotten that, my lady. nor will i. but my father's bannermen have wives and children to protect, and smallfolk who will die should they choose wrongly. his grace asks much of them. give them time, and you will have your answers. answers such as this? stannis crushed lyanna's letter in his fist. even in the north men fear the wroth of tywin lannister. boltons make bad enemies as well. it is not happenstance that put a flayed man on their banners. they north rode with robb, bled with him, died for him. they have supped on grief and death, and now you come to offer them another serving. do you blame them if they hang back? forgive me, your grace, but some will look at you and see only another doomed pretender. if his grace is doomed, your realm is doomed as well, said lady melisandre. remember that, lord snow. it is the one true king of westerns who stands before you. jon kept his face a mask. as you say, my lady. stannis snorted. you spend your words as if every one were a golden dragon. i wonder, how much gold do you have laid by? gold? are those the dragons the red woman means to wake? dragons made of gold? such taxes as we collect are paid in kind, your grace. the watch is rich in turnips but poor in coin. turnips are not like to appease salladhor saan. i require gold or silver. for that, you need white harbor. the city cannot compare to old-town or king's landing, but it is still a thriving port. lord manderly is the richest of my lord father's bannermen. lord too-fat-to-sit-a-horse. the letter that lord wyman manderly had sent back from white harbor had spoken of his age and infirmity, and little more. stannis had commanded jon not to speak of that one either. perhaps his lordship would fancy a wildling wife, said lady melisandre. is this fat man married, lord snow? his lady wife is long dead. lord wyman has two grown sons, and grandchildren by the elder. and he is too fat to sit a horse, thirty stone at least. val would never have him. just once you might try to give me an answer that would please me, lord snow, the king grumbled. i would hope the truth would please you, sire. your men call val a princess, but to the free folk she is only the sister of their king's dead wife. if you force her to marry a man she does not want, she is like to slit his throat on their wedding night. even if she accepts her husband, that does not mean the wildlings will follow him, or you. the only man who can bind them to your cause is mance rayder. i know that, stannis said, unhappily. i have spent hours speaking with the man. he knows much and more of our true enemy, and there is cunning in him, i'll grant you. even if he were to renounce his kingship, though, the man remains an oathbreaker. suffer one deserter to live, and you encourage others to desert. no. laws should be made of iron, not of pudding. mance rayder's life is forfeit by every law of the seven kingdoms. the law ends at the wall, your grace. you could make good use of mance. i mean to. i'll burn him, and the north will see how i deal with turncloaks and traitors. i have other men to lead the wildlings. and i have rayder's son, do not forget. once the father dies, his whelp will be the king-beyond-the-wall. your grace is mistaken. you know nothing, jon snow, ygritte used to say, but he had learned. the babe is no more a prince than val is a princess. you do not become king-beyond-the-wall because your father was. good, said stannis, for i will suffer no other kings in westerns. have you signed the grant? no, your grace. and now it comes. jon closed his burned fingers and opened them again. you ask too much. ask? i asked you to be lord of winterf ell and warden of the north. i require these castles. we have ceded you the nightfort. rats and ruins. it is a niggard's gift that costs the giver nothing. your own man yarwyck says it will be half a year before the castle can be made fit for habitation. the other forts are no better. i know that. it makes no matter. they are all we have. there are nineteen forts along the wall, and you have men in only three of them. i mean to have every one of them garrisoned again before the year is out. i have no quarrel with that, sire, but it is being said that you also mean to grant these castles to your knights and lords, to hold as their own seats as vassals to your grace. kings are expected to be open-handed to their followers. did lord eddard teach his bastard nothing? many of my knights and lords abandoned rich lands and stout castles in the south. should their loyalty go unrewarded? if your grace wishes to lose all of my lord father's bannermen, there is no more certain way than by giving northern halls to southron lords. how can i lose men i do not have? i had hoped to bestow winterfell on a northman, you may recall. a son of eddard stark. he threw my offer in my face. stannis baratheon with a grievance was like a mastiff with a bone; he gnawed it down to splinters. by right winterfell should go to my sister sansa. lady lannister, you mean? are you so eager to see the imp perched on your father's seat? i promise you, that will not happen whilst i live, lord snow. jon knew better than to press the point. sire, some claim that you mean to grant lands and castles to rattleshirt and the magnar of thenn. who told you that? the talk was all over castle black. if you must know, i had the tale from gilly. who is gilly? the wet nurse, said lady melisandre. your grace gave her freedom of the castle. not for running tales. she's wanted for her teats, not for her tongue. i'll have more milk from her, and fewer messages. castle black needs no useless mouths, jon agreed. i am sending gil ly south on the next ship out of eastwatch. melisandre touched the ruby at her neck. gilly is giving suck to dalla's son as well as her own. it seems cruel of you to part our little prince from his milk brother, my lord. careful now, careful. mother's milk is all they share. gilly's son is larger and more robust. he kicks the prince and pinches him, and shoves him from the breast. craster was his father, a cruel man and greedy, and blood tells. the king was confused. i thought the wet nurse was this man craster's daughter? wife and daughter both, your grace. craster married all his daughters. gilly's boy was the fruit of their union. her own father got this child on her? stannis sounded shocked. we are well rid of her, then. i will not suffer such abominations here. this is not king's landing. i can find another wet nurse. if there's none amongst the wildlings, i will send to the mountain clans. until such time, goat's milk should suffice for the boy, if it please your grace. poor fare for a prince ... but better than whore's milk, aye. stannis drummed his fingers on the map. if we may return to the matter of these forts ... your grace, said jon, with chilly courtesy, i have housed your men and fed them, at dire cost to our winter stores. i have clothed them so they would not freeze. stannis was not appeased. aye, you've shared your salt pork and porridge, and you've thrown us some black rags to keep us warm. rags the wildlings would have taken off your corpses if i had not come north. jon ignored that. i have given you fodder for your horses, and once the stair is done i will lend you builders to restore the nightfort. i have even agreed to allow you to settle wildlings on the gift, which was given to the night's watch in perpetuity. you offer me empty lands and desolations, yet deny me the castles i require to reward my lords and bannermen. the night's watch built those castles ... and the night's watch abandoned them. ... to defend the wall, jon finished stubbornly, not as seats for southron lords. the stones of those forts are mortared with the blood and bones of my brothers, long dead. i cannot give them to you. cannot or will not? the cords in the king's neck stood out sharp as swords. i offered you a name. i have a name, your grace. snow. was ever a name more ill-omened? stannis touched his sword hilt. just who do you imagine that you are? the watcher on the walls. the sword in the darkness. don't prate your words at me. stannis drew the blade he called lightbringer. here is your sword in the darkness. light rippled up and down the blade, now red, now yellow, now orange, painting the king's face in harsh, bright hues. even a green boy should be able to see that. are you blind? no, sire. i agree these castles must be garrisoned— the boy commander agrees. how fortunate. —by the night's watch. you do not have the men. then give me men, sire. i will provide officers for each of the abandoned forts, seasoned commanders who know the wall and the lands beyond, and how best to survive the coming winter. in return for all we've given you, grant me the men to fill out the garrisons. men-at-arms, cross-bowmen, raw boys. i will even take your wounded and infirm. stannis stared at him incredulously, then gave a bark of laughter. you are bold enough, snow, i grant you that, but you're mad if you think my men will take the black. they can wear any color cloak they choose, so long as they obey my officers as they would your own. the king was unmoved. i have knights and lords in my service, scions of noble houses old in honor. they cannot be expected to serve under poachers, peasants, and murderers. or bastards, sire? your own hand is a smuggler. was a smuggler. i shortened his fingers for that. they tell me that you are the nine-hundred-ninety-eighth man to command the night's watch, lord snow. what do you think the nine-hundred-ninety-ninth might say about these castles? the sight of your head on a spike might inspire him to be more helpful. the king laid his bright blade down on the map, along the wall, its steel shimmering like sunlight on water. you are only lord commander by my sufferance. you would do well to remember that. i am lord commander because my brothers chose me. there were mornings when jon snow did not quite believe it himself, when he woke up thinking surely this was some mad dream. it's like putting on new clothes, sam had told him. the fit feels strange at first, but once you've worn them for a while you get to feeling comfortable. alliser thorne complains about the manner of your choosing, and i cannot say he does not have a grievance. the map lay between them like a battleground, drenched by the colors of the glowing sword. the count was done by a blind man with your fat friend by his elbow. and slynt names you a turncloak. and who would know one better than slynt? a turncloak would tell you what you wished to hear and betray you later. your grace knows that i was fairly chosen. my father always said you were a just man. just but harsh had been lord eddard's exact words, but jon did not think it would be wise to share that. lord eddard was no friend to me, but he was not without some sense. he would have given me these castles. never. i cannot speak to what my father might have done. i took an oath, your grace. the wall is mine. for now. we will see how well you hold it. stannis pointed at him. keep your ruins, as they mean so much to you. i promise you, though, if any remain empty when the year is out, i will take them with your leave or without it. and if even one should fall to the foe, your head will soon follow. now get out. lady melisandre rose from her place near the hearth. with your leave, sire, i will show lord snow back to his chambers. why? he knows the way. stannis waved them both away. do what you will. devan, food. boiled eggs and lemon water. after the warmth of the king's solar, the turnpike stair felt bone-chillingly cold. wind's rising, m'lady, the serjeant warned melisandre as he handed jon back his weapons. you might want a warmer cloak. i have my faith to warm me. the red woman walked beside jon down the steps. his grace is growing fond of you. i can tell. he only threatened to behead me twice. melisandre laughed. it is his silences you should fear, not his words. as they stepped out into the yard, the wind filled jon's cloak and sent it flapping against her. the red priestess brushed the black wool aside and slipped her arm through his. it may be that you are not wrong about the wildling king. i shall pray for the lord of light to send me guidance. when i gaze into the flames, i can see through stone and earth, and find the truth within men's souls. i can speak to kings long dead and children not yet born, and watch the years and seasons flicker past, until the end of days. are your fires never wrong? never ... though we priests are mortal and sometimes err, mistaking this must come for this may come. jon could feel her heat, even through his wool and boiled leather. the sight of them arm in arm was drawing curious looks. they will be whispering in the barracks tonight. if you can truly see the morrow in your flames, tell me when and where the next wildling attack will come. he slipped his arm free. r'hllor sends us what visions he will, but i shall seek for this man tormund in the flames. melisandre's red lips curled into a smile. i have seen you in my fires, jon snow. is that a threat, my lady? do you mean to burn me too? you mistake my meaning. she gave him a searching look. i fear that i make you uneasy, lord snow. jon did not deny it. the wall is no place for a woman. you are wrong. i have dreamed of your wall, jon snow. great was the lore that raised it, and great the spells locked beneath its ice. we walk beneath one of the hinges of the world. melisandre gazed up at it, her breath a warm moist cloud in the air. this is my place as it is yours, and soon enough you may have grave need of me. do not refuse my friendship, jon. i have seen you in the storm, hard-pressed, with enemies on every side. you have so many enemies. shall i tell you their names? i know their names. do not be so certain. the ruby at melisandre's throat gleamed red. it is not the foes who curse you to your face that you must fear, but those who smile when you are looking and sharpen their knives when you turn your back. you would do well to keep your wolf close beside you. ice, i see, and daggers in the dark. blood frozen red and hard, and naked steel. it was very cold. it is always cold on the wall. you think so? i know so, my lady. then you know nothing, jon snow, she whispered. jon snow read the letter over until the words began to blur and run together. / cannot sign this. i will not sign this. he almost burned the parchment then and there. instead he took a sip of ale, the dregs of the half cup that remained from his solitary supper the night before. / have to sign it. they chose me to be their lord commander. the wall is mine, and the watch as well. the night's watch takes no part. it was a relief when dolorous edd tollett opened the door to tell him that gilly was without. jon set maester aemon's letter aside. i will see her. he dreaded this. find sam for me. i will want to speak with him next. he'll be down with the books. my old septon used to say that books are dead men talking. dead men should keep quiet, is what i say. no one wants to hear a dead man's yabber. dolorous edd went off muttering of worms and spiders. when gilly entered, she went at once to her knees. jon came around the table and drew her to her feet. you don't need to take a knee for me. that's just for kings. though a wife and mother, gilly still seemed half a child to him, a slender little thing wrapped up in one of sam's old cloaks. the cloak was so big on her that she could have hidden several other girls beneath its folds. the babes are well? he asked her. the wildling girl smiled timidly from under her cowl. yes, m'lord. i was scared i wouldn't have milk enough for both, but the more they suck, the more i have. they're strong. i have something hard to tell you. he almost said ask, but caught himself at the last instant. is it mance? val begged the king to spare him. she said she'd let some kneeler marry her and never slit his throat if only mance could live. that lord o'bones, he's to be spared. craster always swore he'd kill him if he ever showed his face about the keep. mance never did half the things he done. all mance ever did was lead an army down upon the realm he once swore to protect. mance said our words, gilly. then he turned his cloak, wed dalla, and crowned himself king-beyond-the-wall. his life is in the king's hands now. it's not him we need to talk about. it's his son. dalla's boy. the babe? her voice trembled. he never broke no oath, m'lord. he sleeps and cries and sucks, is all; he's never done no harm to no one. don't let her burn him. save him, please. only you can do that, gilly. jon told her how. another woman would have shrieked at him, cursed him, damned him down to seven hells. another woman might have flown at him in rage, slapped him, kicked him, raked at his eyes with her nails. another woman might have thrown her defiance in his teeth. gilly shook her head. no. please, no. the raven picked up the word. no, it screamed. refuse, and the boy will burn. not on the morrow, nor the day after ... but soon, whenever melisandre needs to wake a dragon or raise a wind or work some other spell requiring king's blood. mance will be ash and bone by then, so she will claim his son for the fire, and stannis will not deny her. if you do not take the boy away, she will burn him. i'll go, said gilly. i'll take him, i'll take the both o' them, dalla's boy and mine. tears rolled down her cheeks. if not for the way the candle made them glisten, jon might never have known that she was weeping. craster's wives would have taught their daughters to shed their tears into a pillow. perhaps they went outside to weep, well away from craster's fists. jon closed the fingers of his sword hand. take both boys and the queen's men will ride after you and drag you back. the boy will still burn ... and you with him. /// comfort her, she may think that tears can move me. she has to realize that i will not yield. you'll take one boy, and that one dalla's. a mother can't leave her son, or else she's cursed forever. not a son. we saved him, sam and me. please. please, m'lord. we saved him from the cold. men say that freezing to death is almost peaceful. fire, though ... do you see the candle, gilly? she looked at the flame. yes. touch it. put your hand over the flame. her big brown eyes grew bigger still. she did not move. do it. kill the boy. now. trembling, the girl reached out her hand, held it well above the flickering candle flame. down. let it kiss you. g illy lowered her hand. an inch. another. when the flame licked her flesh, she snatched her hand back and began to sob. fire is a cruel way to die. dalla died to give this child life, but you have nourished him, cherished him. you saved your own boy from the ice. now save hers from the fire. they'll burn my babe, then. the red woman. if she can't have dalla's, she'll burn mine. your son has no king's blood. melisandre gains nothing by giving him to the fire. stannis wants the free folk to fight for him, he will not burn an innocent without good cause. your boy will be safe. i will find a wet nurse for him and he'll be raised here at castle black under my protection. he'll learn to hunt and ride, to fight with sword and axe and bow. i'll even see that he is taught to read and write. sam would like that. and when he is old enough, he will learn the truth of who he is. he'll be free to seek you out if that is what he wants. you will make a crow of him. she wiped at her tears with the back of a small pale hand. i won't. i won't. kill the boy, thought jon. you will. else i promise you, the day that they burn dalla's boy, yours will die as well. die, shrieked the old bear's raven. die, die, die. the girl sat hunched and shrunken, staring at the candle flame, tears glistening in her eyes. finally jon said, you have my leave to go. do not speak of this, but see that you are ready to depart an hour before first light. my men will come for you. gilly got to her feet. pale and wordless, she departed, with never a look back at him. jon heard her footsteps as she rushed through the armory. she was almost running. when he went to close the door, jon saw that ghost was stretched out beneath the anvil, gnawing on the bone of an ox. the big white direwolf looked up at his approach. past time that you were back. he returned to his chair, to read over maester aemon's letter once again. samwell tarly turned up a few moments later, clutching a stack of books. no sooner had he entered than mormont's raven flew at him demanding corn. sam did his best to oblige, offering some kernels from the sack beside the door. the raven did its best to peck through his palm. sam yowled, the bird flapped off, corn scattered. did that wretch break the skin? jon asked. sam gingerly removed his glove. he did. i'm bleeding. we all shed our blood for the watch. wear thicker gloves. jon shoved a chair toward him with a foot. sit, and have a look at this. he handed sam the parchment. what is it? a paper shield. sam read it slowly. a letter to king tommen? at winterfell, tommen fought my brother bran with wooden swords, jon said, remembering. he wore so much padding he looked like a stuffed goose. bran knocked him to the ground. he went to the window and threw the shutters open. the air outside was cold and bracing, though the sky was a dull grey. yet bran's dead, and pudgy pink-faced tommen is sitting on the iron throne, with a crown nestled amongst his golden curls. that got an odd look from sam, and for a moment he looked as if he wanted to say something. instead he swallowed and turned back to the parchment. you haven't signed the letter. jon shook his head. the old bear begged the iron throne for help a hundred times. they sent him janos slynt. no letter will make the lannisters love us better. not once they hear that we've been helping stannis. only to defend the wall, not in his rebellion. that's what it says here. the distinction may escape lord tywin. jon snatched the letter back. why would he help us now? he never did before. well, he will not want it said that stannis rode to the defense of the realm whilst king tommen was playing with his toys. that would bring scorn down upon house lannister. it's death and destruction i want to bring down upon house lannister, not scorn. jon read from the letter. the night's watch takes no part in the wars of the seven kingdoms. our oaths are sworn to the realm, and the realm now stands in dire peril. stannis baratheon aids us against our foes from beyond the wall, though we are not his men ... sam squirmed in his seat. well, we're not. are we? i gave stannis food, shelter, and the nightfort, plus leave to settle some free folk in the gift. that's all. lord tywin will say it was too much. stannis says it's not enough. the more you give a king, the more he wants. we are walking on a bridge of ice with an abyss on either side. pleasing one king is difficult enough. pleasing two is hardly possible. yes, but ... if the lannisters should prevail and lord tywin decides that we betrayed the king by aiding stannis, it could mean the end of the night's watch. he has the tyrells behind him, with all the strength of highgarden. and he did defeat lord stannis on the blackwater. the blackwater was one battle. robb won all his battles and still lost his head. if stannis can raise the north ... sam hesitated, then said, the lannisters have northmen of their own. lord bolton and his bastard. stannis has the karstarks. if he can win white harbor ... if, sam stressed. if not ... my lord, even a paper shield is better than none. i suppose so. him and aemon both. somehow he had hoped that sam tarly might see it differently. it is only ink and parchment. resigned, he grabbed the quill and signed. get the sealing wax. before i change my mind. sam hastened to obey. jon fixed the lord commander's seal and handed him the letter. take this to maester aemon when you leave, and tell him to dispatch a bird to king's landing. i will. sam sounded relieved. my lord, if i might ask ... i saw gilly leaving. she was almost crying. val sent her to plead for mance again, jon lied, and they talked for a while of mance and stannis and melisandre of asshai, until the raven ate the last corn kernel and screamed, blood. i am sending gilly away, jon said. her and the boy. we will need to find another wet nurse for his milk brother. goat's milk might serve, until you do. it's better for a babe than cow's milk. talking about breasts plainly made sam uncomfortable, and suddenly he began to speak of history, and boy commanders who had lived and died hundreds of years ago. jon cut him off with, tell me something useful. tell me of our enemy. the others. sam licked his lips. they are mentioned in the annals, though not as often as i would have thought. the annals i've found and looked at, that is. there's more i haven't found, i know. some of the older books are falling to pieces. the pages crumble when i try and turn them. and the really old books ... either they have crumbled all away or they are buried somewhere that i haven't looked yet or ... well, it could be that there are no such books and never were. the oldest histories we have were written after the andals came to westerns. the first men only left us runes on rocks, so everything we think we know about the age of heroes and the dawn age and the long night comes from accounts set down by septons thousands of years later. there are archmaesters at the citadel who question all of it. those old histories are full of kings who reigned for hundreds of years, and knights riding around a thousand years before there were knights. you know the tales, brandon the builder, symeon star-eyes, night's king ... we say that you're the nine-hundred-and-ninety-eighth lord commander of the night's watch, but the oldest list i've found shows six hundred seventy-four commanders, which suggests that it was written during— long ago, jon broke in. what about the others? i found mention of dragonglass. the children of the forest used to give the night's watch a hundred obsidian daggers every year, during the age of heroes. the others come when it is cold, most of the tales agree. or else it gets cold when they come. sometimes they appear during snowstorms and melt away when the skies clear. they hide from the light of the sun and emerge by night ... or else night falls when they emerge. some stories speak of them riding the corpses of dead animals. bears, direwolves, mammoths, horses, it makes no matter, so long as the beast is dead. the one that killed small paul was riding a dead horse, so that part's plainly true. some accounts speak of giant ice spiders too. i don't know what those are. men who fall in battle against the others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as their thralls. we knew all this. the question is, how do we fight them? the armor of the others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed, and their own swords are so cold they shatter steel. fire will dismay them, though, and they are vulnerable to obsidian. i found one account of the long night that spoke of the last hero slaying others with a blade of dragonsteel. supposedly they could not stand against it. dragonsteel? the term was new to jon. valyrian steel? that was my first thought as well. so if i can just convince the lords of the seven kingdoms to give us their valyrian blades, all is saved? that won't be hard. no harder than asking them to give up their coin and castles. he gave a bitter laugh. did you find who the others are, where they come from, what they want? not yet, my lord, but it may be that i've just been reading the wrong books. there are hundreds i have not looked at yet. give me more time and i will find whatever there is to be found. there is no more time. you need to get your things together, sam. you're going with gilly. going? sam gaped at him openmouthed, as if he did not understand the meaning of the word. i'm going? to eastwatch, my lord? or ... where am i ... oldtown. oldtown?' sam repeated, in a high-pitched squeak. aemon as well. aemon? maester aemon? but ... he's one hundred and two years old, my lord, he can't ... you're sending him and me? who will tend the ravens? if there's sick or wounded, who ... clydas. he's been with aemon for years. clydas is only a steward, and his eyes are going bad. you need a maester. maester aemon is so frail, a sea voyage ... it might ... he's old, and ... his life will beat risk. i am aware of that, sam, but the risk is greater here. stannis knows who aemon is. if the red woman requires king's blood for her spells ... oh. sam's fat cheeks seemed to drain of color. dareon will join you at eastwatch. my hope is that his songs will win some men for us in the south. the blackbird will deliver you to braavos. from there, you'll arrange your own passage to oldtown. if you still mean to claim gilly's babe as your bastard, send her and the child on to horn hill. elsewise, aemon will find a servant's place for her at the citadel. my b-b-bastard. yes, i ... my mother and my sisters will help gil ly with the child. dareon could see her to oldtown just as well as me. i'm ... i've been working at my archery every afternoon with ulmer, as you commanded ... well, except when i'm in the vaults, but you told me to find out about the others. the longbow makes my shoulders ache and raises blisters on my fingers. he showed jon his hand. i still do it, though. i can hit the target more often than not now, but i'm still the worst archer who ever bent a bow. i like ulmer's stories, though. someone needs to write them down and put them in a book. you do it. they have parchment and ink at the citadel, as well as longbows. i will expect you to continue with your practice. sam, the night's watch has hundreds of men who can loose an arrow, but only a handful who can read or write. i need you to become my new maester. my lord, i ... my work is here, the books ... ... will be here when you return to us. sam put a hand to his throat. my lord, the citadel ... they make you cut up corpses there. i cannot wear a chain. you can. you will. maester aemon is old and blind. his strength is leaving him. who will take his place when he dies? maester mullin at the shadow tower is more fighter than scholar, and maester harmune of eastwatch is drunk more than he's sober. if you ask the citadel for more maesters ... i mean to. we'll have need of every one. aemon targaryen is not so easily replaced, however. this is not going as i had hoped. he had known gil ly would be hard, but he had assumed sam would be glad to trade the dangers of the wall for the warmth of oldtown. i was certain this would please you, he said, puzzled. there are so many books at the citadel that no man can hope to read them all. you would do well there, sam. i know you would. no. i could read the books, but ... a m-maester must be a healer and b-b-blood makes me faint. his hand shook, to prove the truth of that. i'm sam the scared, not sam the slayer. scared? of what? the chidings of old men? sam, you saw the wights come swarming up the fist, a tide of living dead men with black hands and bright blue eyes. you slew an other. it was the d-d-d-dragonglass, not me. be quiet, jon snapped. after gilly, he had no patience for the fat boy's fears. you lied and schemed and plotted to make me lord commander. you will obey me. you'll go to the citadel and forge a chain, and if you have to cut up corpses, so be it. at least in oldtown the corpses won't object. my lord, my f-f-f-father, lord randyll, he, he, he, he, he ... the life of a maester is a life of servitude. no son of house tarly will ever wear a chain. the men of horn hill do not bow and scrape to petty lords. jon, i cannot disobey my father. kill the boy, jon thought. the boy in you, and the one in him. kill the both of them, you bloody bastard. you have no father. only brothers. only us. your life belongs to the night's watch, so go and stuff your small-clothes into a sack, along with anything else you care to take to oldtown. you leave an hour before sunrise. and here's another order. from this day forth, you will not call yourself a craven. you've faced more things this past year than most men face in a lifetime. you can face the citadel, but you'll face it as a sworn brother of the night's watch. i can't command you to be brave, but i can command you to hide your fears. you said the words, sam. remember? i ... i'll try. you won't try. you will obey. obey. mormont's raven flapped its great black wings. sam seemed to sag. as my lord commands. does ... does maester aemon know? it was as much his idea as mine. jon opened the door for him. no farewells. the fewer folk who know of this, the better. an hour before first light, by the lichyard. sam fled from him just as gilly had. jon was tired. i need sleep. he had been up half the night poring over maps, writing letters, and making plans with maester aemon. even after stumbling into his narrow bed, rest had not come easily. he knew what he would face today, and found himself tossing restlessly as he brooded on maester aemon's final words. allow me to give my lord one last piece of counsel, the old man had said, the same counsel that i once gave my brother when we parted for the last time. he was three-and-thirty when the great council chose him to mount the iron throne. a man grown with sons of his own, yet in some ways still a boy. egg had an innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved. kill the boy within you, i told him the day i took ship for the wall. it takes a man to rule. an aegon, not an egg. kill the boy and let the man be born. the old man felt jon's face. you are half the age that egg was, and your own burden is a crueler one, i fear. you will have little joy of your command, but i think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done. kill the boy, jon snow. winter is almost upon us. kill the boy and let the man be born. jon donned his cloak and strode outside. he made the rounds of castle black each day, visiting the men on watch and hearing their reports first hand, watching ulmer and his charges at the archery butts, talking with king's men and queen's men alike, walking the ice atop the wall to have a look at the forest. ghost padded after him, a white shadow at his side. kedge whit eye had the wall when jon made his ascent. kedge had seen forty-odd namedays, thirty of them on the wall. his left eye was blind, his right eye mean. in the wild, alone with axe and garron, he was as good a ranger as any in the watch, but he had never gotten on well with the other men. a quiet day, he told jon. nothing to report, except the wrong-way rangers. the wrong-way rangers? jon asked. kedge grinned. a pair of knights. went riding off an hour ago, south along the kingsroad. when dywen saw them buggering off, he said the southron fools were riding the wrong way. i see, said jon. he found out more from dywen himself, as the old forester sucked down a bowl of barley broth in the barracks. aye, m'lord, i saw them. horpe and massey, it were. claimed stannis sent 'em out, but never said where or what for or when they would be back. ser richard horpe and ser justin massey were both queen's men, and high in the king's councils. a pair of common freeriders would have served if all that stannis had in mind was scouting, jon snow reflected, but knights are better suited to act as messengers or envoys. cotter pyke had sent word from eastwatch that the onion lord and salladhor saan had set sail for white harbor to treat with lord manderly. it made sense that stannis would send out other envoys. his grace was not a patient man. whether the wrong-way rangers would return was another question. knights they might be, but they did not know the north. there will be eyes along the kingsroad, not all of them friendly. it was none of jon's concern, though. let stannis have his secrets. the gods know that i have mine. ghost slept at the foot of the bed that night, and for once jon did not dream he was a wolf. even so, he slept fitfully, tossing for hours before sliding down into a nightmare. gilly was in it, weeping, pleading with him to leave her babes alone, but he ripped the children from her arms and hacked their heads off, then swapped the heads around and told her to sew them back in place. when he woke, he found edd tollett looming over him in the darkness of his bedchamber. m'lord? it is time. the hour of the wolf. you left orders to be woken. bring me something hot. jon threw off his blankets. edd was back by the time that he had dressed, pressing a steaming cup into his hands. jon expected hot mulled wine, and was surprised to find that it was soup, a thin broth that smelled of leeks and carrots but seemed to have no leeks or carrots in it. the smells are stronger in my wolf dreams, he reflected, and food tastes richer too. ghost is more alive than i am. he left the empty cup upon the forge. kegs was on his door this morning. i will want to speak with bedwyck and with janos slynt, jon told him. have them both here at first light. outside the world was black and still. cold, but not dangerously cold. not yet. it will be warmer when the sun comes up. if the gods are good, the wall may weep. when they reached the lichyard, the column had already formed up. jon had given black jack bulwer command of the escort, with a dozen mounted rangers under him, and two wayns. one was piled high with chests and crates and sacks, provisions for the journey. the other had a stiff roof of boiled leather to keep the wind off. maester aemon was seated in the back of it, huddled in a bearskin that made him look as small as a child. sam and gilly stood nearby. her eyes were red and puffy, but the boy was in her arms, bundled tight. whether it was her boy or dalla's he could not be sure. he had only seen the two together a few times. gilly's boy was older, dalla's more robust, but they were close enough in age and size so that no one who did not know them well would be able to easily tell one from the other. lord snow, maester aemon called out, i left a book for you in my chambers. the jade compendium. it was written by the volantene adventurer colloquo votar, who traveled to the east and visited all the lands of the jade sea. there is a passage you may find of interest. i've told clydas to mark it for you. i'll be sure to read it. maester aemon wiped his nose. knowledge is a weapon, jon. arm yourself well before you ride forth to battle. i will. jon felt something wet and cold upon his face. when he raised his eyes, he saw that it was snowing. a bad omen. he turned to black jack bulwer. make as good a time as you can, but take no foolish risks. you have an old man and a suckling babe with you. see that you keep them warm and well fed. you do the same, m'lord. gilly did not seem in any haste to climb into the wayn. you do the same for t'other. find another wet nurse, like you said. you promised me you would. the boy ... dalla's boy ... the little prince, i mean ... you find him some good woman, so he grows up big and strong. you have my word. don't you name him. don't you do that, till he's past two years. it's ill luck to name them when they're still on the breast. you crows may not know that, but it's true. as you command, my lady. don't you call me that. i'm a mother, not a lady. i'm craster's wife and craster's daughter, and a mother. she gave the babe to dolorous edd as she climbed into the wayn and covered herself with furs. when edd gave her back the child, gilly put him to her breast. sam turned away from the sight, red-faced, and heaved himself up onto his mare. let's do this, commanded blackjack bulwer, snapping his whip. the wayns rolled forward. sam lingered a moment. well, he said, farewell. and to you, sam, said dolorous edd. your boat's not like to sink, i don't think. boats only sink when i'm aboard. jon was remembering. the first time i saw gilly she was pressed back against the wall of craster's keep, this skinny darkhaired girl with her big belly, cringing away from ghost. he had gotten in among her rabbits, and i think she was frightened that he would tear her open and devour the babe ... but it was not the wolf she should have been afraid of, was it? she has more courage than she knows, said sam. so do you, sam. have a swift, safe voyage, and take care of her and aemon and the child. the cold trickles on his face reminded jon of the day he'd bid farewell to robb at winterfell, never knowing that it was for the last time. and pull your hood up. the snowflakes are melting in your hair. by the time the little column had dwindled in the distance, the eastern sky had gone from black to grey and the snow was falling heavily. giant will be waiting on the lord commander's pleasure, dolorous edd reminded him. janos slynt as well. yes. jon snow glanced up at the wall, towering over them like a cliff of ice. a hundred leagues from end to end, and seven hundred feet high. the strength of the wall was its height; the length of the wall was its weakness. jon remembered something his father had said once. a wall is only as strong as the men who stand behind it. the men of the night's watch were brave enough, but they were far too few for the task that confronted them. giant was waiting in the armory. his real name was bedwyck. at a hair and a half over five feet he was the smallest man in the night's watch. jon came directly to the point. we need more eyes along the wall. way-castles where our patrols can get out of the cold and find hot food and a fresh mount. i am putting a garrison in icemark and giving you command of it. giant put the tip of his little finger in his ear to clean out the wax. command? me? m'lord knows i'm just a crofter's get, on the wall for poaching? you've been a ranger for a dozen years. you survived the fist of the first men and craster's keep, and came back to tell the tale. the younger men look up to you. the small man laughed. only dwarfs look up to me. i don't read, my lord. on a good day i can write my name. i've sent to oldtown for more maesters. you'll have two ravens for when your need is urgent. when it's not, send riders. until we have more maesters and more birds, i mean to establish a line of beacon towers along the top of the wall. and how many poor fools will i be commanding? twenty, from the watch, said jon, and half as many men from stannis. old, green, or wounded. they won't be his best men, and none will take the black, but they'll obey. make what use of them you can. four of the brothers i'm sending with you will be kingslanders who came to the wall with lord slynt. keep one eye on that lot and watch for climbers with the other. we can watch, m'lord, but if enough climbers gain the top o' the wall, thirty men won't be enough to throw them off. three hundred might not be enough. jon kept that doubt to himself. it was true that climbers were desperately vulnerable whilst on the ascent. stones and spears and pots of burning pitch could be rained down on them from above, and all they could do was cling desperately to the ice. sometimes the wall itself seemed to shake them off, as a dog might shake off fleas. jon had seen that for himself, when a sheet of ice cracked beneath val's lover jarl, sending him to his death. if the climbers reached the top of the wall undetected, however, everything changed. given time, they could carve out a toehold for themselves up there, throwing up ramparts of their own and dropping ropes and ladders for thousands more to clamber over after them. that was how raymun redbeard had done it, raymun who had been king-beyond-the-wall in the days of his grandfather's grandfather. jack musgood had been the lord commander in those days. jolly jack, he was called before redbeard came down upon the north; sleepy jack, forever after. raymun's host had met a bloody end on the shores of long lake, caught between lord willam of winterfell and the drunken giant, harmond umber. red-beard had been slain by artos the implacable, lord willam's younger brother. the watch arrived too late to fight the wildlings, but in time to bury them, the task that artos stark assigned them in his wroth as he grieved above the headless corpse of his fallen brother. jon did not intend to be remembered as sleepy jon snow. thirty men will stand a better chance than none, he told giant. true enough, the small man said. is it just to be icemark, then, or will m'lord be opening t'other forts as well? i mean to garrison all of them, in time, said jon, but for the moment, it will just be icemark and greyguard. and has m'lord decided who's to command at greyguard? janos slynt, said jon. gods save us. a man does not rise to command of the gold cloaks without ability. slynt was born a butcher's son. he was captain of the iron gate when manly stokeworth died, and jon arryn raised him up and put the defense of king's landing into his hands. lord janos cannot be as great a fool as he seems. and i want him well away from alliser thome. might be that's so, said giant, but i'd still send him to the kitchens to help three-finger hobb cut up the turnips. /// did, i'd never dare to eat another turnip. half the morning passed before lord janos reported as commanded. jon was cleaning longclaw. some men would have given that task to a steward or a squire, but lord eddard had taught his sons to care for their own weapons. when kegs and dolorous edd arrived with slynt, jon thanked them and bid lord janos sit. that he did, albeit with poor grace, crossing his arms, scowling, and ignoring the naked steel in his lord commander's hands. jon slid the oilcloth down his bastard sword, watching the play of morning light across the ripples, thinking how easily the blade would slide through skin and fat and sinew to part slynt's ugly head from his body. all of a man's crimes were wiped away when he took the black, and all of his allegiances as well, yet he found it hard to think of janos slynt as a brother. there is blood between us. this man helped slay my father and did his best to have me killed as well. lord janos. jon sheathed his sword. i am giving you command of greyguard. that took slynt aback. greyguard ... greyguard was where you climbed the wall with your wildling friends ... it was. the fort is in a sorry state, admittedly. you will restore it as best you can. start by clearing back the forest. steal stones from the structures that have collapsed to repair those still standing. the work will be hard and brutal, he might have added. you'll sleep on stone, too exhausted to complain or plot, and soon you'll forget what it was like to be warm, but you might remember what it was to be a man. you will have thirty men. ten from here, ten from the shadow tower, and ten lent to us by king stannis. slynt's face had turned the color of a prune. his meaty jowls began to quiver. do you think i cannot see what you are doing? janos slynt is not a man to be gulled so easily. i was charged with the defense of king's landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes. keep your ruin, bastard. / am giving you a chance, my lord. it is more than you ever gave my father. you mistake me, my lord, jon said. that was a command, not an offer. it is forty leagues to greyguard. pack up your arms and armor, say your farewells, and be ready to depart at first light on the morrow. no. lord janos lurched to his feet, sending his chair crashing over backwards. i will not go meekly off to freeze and die. no traitor's bastard gives commands to janos slynt! i am not without friends, i warn you. here, and in king's landing too. i was the lord of harrenhal! give your ruin to one of the blind fools who cast a stone for you, i will not have it. do you hear me, boy? / will not have it! you will. slynt did not deign to answer that, but he kicked the chair aside as he departed. he still sees me as a boy, jon thought, a green boy, to be cowed by angry words. he could only hope that a night's sleep would bring lord janos to his senses. the next morning proved that hope was vain. jon found slynt breaking his fast in the common room. ser alliser thorne was with him, and several of their cronies. they were laughing about something when jon came down the steps with iron emmett and dolorous edd, and behind them mully, horse, red jack crabb, rusty flowers, and owen the oaf. three-finger hobb was ladling out porridge from his kettle. queen's men, king's men, and black brothers sat at their separate tables, some bent over bowls of porridge, others filling their bellies with fried bread and bacon. jon saw pyp and grenn at one table, bowen marsh at another. the air smelled of smoke and grease, and the clatter of knives and spoons echoed off the vaulted ceiling. all the voices died at once. lord janos, jon said, i will give you one last chance. put down that spoon and get to the stables. i have had your horse saddled and bridled. it is a long, hard road to greyguard. then you had best be on your way, boy. slynt laughed, dribbling porridge down his chest. greyguard's a good place for the likes of you, i'm thinking. well away from decent godly folk. the mark of the beast is on you, bastard. you are refusing to obey my order? you can stick your order up your bastard's arse, said slynt, his jowls quivering. alliser thorne smiled a thin smile, his black eyes fixed on jon. at another table, godry the giantslayer began to laugh. as you will. jon nodded to iron emmett. please take lord janos to the wall— —and confine him to an ice cell, he might have said. a day or ten cramped up inside the ice would leave him shivering and feverish and begging for release, jon did not doubt. and the moment he is out, he and thorne will begin to plot again. —and tie him to his horse, he might have said. if slynt did not wish to go to greyguard as its commander, he could go as its cook. it will only be a matter of time until he deserts, then. and how many others will he take with him? —and hang him, jon finished. janos slynt's face went as white as milk. the spoon slipped from his fingers. edd and emmett crossed the room, their footsteps ringing on the stone floor. bowen marsh's mouth opened and closed though no words came out. ser alliser thorne reached for his sword hilt. go on, jon thought. longclaw was slung across his back. show your steel. give me cause to do the same. half the men in the hall were on their feet. southron knights and men-at-arms, loyal to king stannis or the red woman or both, and sworn brothers of the night's watch. some had chosen jon to be their lord commander. others had cast their stones for bowen marsh, ser denys mal-lister, cotter pyke ... and some for janos slynt. hundreds of them, as i recall. jon wondered how many of those men were in the cellar right now. for a moment the world balanced on a sword's edge. alliser thorne took his hand from his sword and stepped aside to let edd tollett pass. dolorous edd took hold of slynt by one arm, iron emmett by the other. together they hauled him from the bench. no, lord janos protested, flecks of porridge spraying from his lips. no, unhand me. he's just a boy, a bastard. his father was a traitor. the mark of the beast is on him, that wolf of his ... let go of me! you will rue the day you laid hands on janos slynt. i have friends in king's landing. i warn you— he was still protesting as they half-marched, half-dragged him up the steps. jon followed them outside. behind him, the cellar emptied. at the cage, slynt wrenched loose for a moment and tried to make a fight of it, but iron emmett caught him by the throat and slammed him back against the iron bars until he desisted. by then all of castle black had come outside to watch. even val was at her window, her long golden braid across one shoulder. stannis stood on the steps of the king's tower, surrounded by his knights. if the boy thinks that he can frighten me, he is mistaken, they heard lord janos said. he would not dare to hang me. janos slynt has friends, important friends, you'll see ... the wind whipped away the rest of his words. this is wrong, jon thought. stop. emmett turned back, frowning. my lord? i will not hang him, said jon. bring him here. oh, seven save us, he heard bowen marsh cry out. the smile that lord janos slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. until jon said, edd, fetch me a block, and unsheathed longclaw. by the time a suitable chopping block was found, lord janos had retreated into the winch cage, but iron emmett went in after him and dragged him out. no, slynt cried, as emmett half-shoved and half-pulled him across the yard. unhand me ... you cannot ... when tywin lannister hears of this, you will all rue— emmett kicked his legs out from under him. dolorous edd planted a foot on his back to keep him on his knees as emmett shoved the block beneath his head. this will go easier if you stay still, jon snow promised him. move to avoid the cut, and you will still die, but your dying will be uglier. stretch out your neck, my lord. the pale morning sunlight ran up and down his blade as jon clasped the hilt of the bastard sword with both hands and raised it high. if you have any last words, now is the time to speak them, he said, expecting one last curse. janos slynt twisted his neck around to stare up at him. please, my lord. mercy. i'll ... i'll go, i will, i ... no, thought jon. you closed that door. longclaw descended. can i have his boots? asked owen the oaf, as janos slynt's head went rolling across the muddy ground. they're almost new, those boots. lined with fur. jon glanced back at stannis. for an instant their eyes met. then the king nodded and went back inside his tower. they brought forth the king-beyond-the-wall with his hands bound by hempen rope and a noose around his neck. the other end of the rope was looped about the saddle horn of ser godry farring's courser. the giantslayer and his mount were armored in silvered steel inlaid with niello. mance rayder wore only a thin tunic that left his limbs naked to the cold. they could have let him keep his cloak, jon snow thought, the one the wildling woman patched with strips of crimson silk. small wonder that the wall was weeping. mance knows the haunted forest better than any ranger, jon had told king stannis, in his final effort to convince his grace that the king-beyond-the-wall would be of more use to them alive than dead. he knows tormund giantsbane. he has fought the others. and he had the horn of joramun and did not blow it. he did not bring down the wall when he could have. his words fell on deaf ears. stannis had remained unmoved. the law was plain; a deserter's life was forfeit. beneath the weeping wall, lady melisandre raised her pale white hands. we all must choose, she proclaimed. man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. her voice made jon snow think of anise and nutmeg and cloves. she stood at the king's side on a wooden scaffold raised above the pit. we choose light or we choose darkness. we choose good or we choose evil. we choose the true god or the false. mance rayder's thick grey-brown hair blew about his face as he walked. he pushed it from his eyes with bound hands, smiling. but when he saw the cage, his courage failed him. the queen's men had made it from the trees of the haunted forest, from saplings and supple branches, pine boughs sticky with sap, and the bone-white fingers of the weirwoods. they'd bent them and twisted them around and through each other to weave a wooden lattice, then hung it high above a deep pit filled with logs, leaves, and kindling. the wildling king recoiled from the sight. no, he cried, mercy. this is not right, i'm not the king, they— ser godry gave a pull on the rope. the king-beyond-the-wall had no choice but to stumble after him, the rope choking off his words. when he lost his feet, godry dragged him the rest of the way. mance was bloody when the queen's men half-shoved, half-carried him to the cage. a dozen men-at-arms heaved together to hoist him into the air. lady melisandre watched him rise. free folk! here stands your king of lies. and here is the horn he promised would bring down the wall. two queen's men brought forth the horn of joramun, black and banded with old gold, eight feet long from end to end. runes were carved into the golden bands, the writing of the first men. joramun had died thousands of years ago, but mance had found his grave beneath a glacier, high up in the frostfangs. and joramun blew the horn of winter, and woke giants from the earth. ygritte had told jon that mance never found the horn. she lied, or else mance kept it secret even from his own. a thousand captives watched through the wooden bars of their stockade as the horn was lifted high. all were ragged and half-starved. wild-lings, the seven kingdoms called them; they named themselves the free folk. they looked neither wild nor free— only hungry, frightened, numb. the horn of joramun? melisandre said. no. call it the horn of darkness. if the wall falls, night falls as well, the long night that never ends. it must not happen, will not happen ! the lord of light has seen his children in their peril and sent a champion to them, azor ahai reborn. she swept a hand toward stannis, and the great ruby at her throat pulsed with light. he is stone and she is flame. the king's eyes were blue bruises, sunk deep in a hollow face. he wore grey plate, a fur-trimmed cloak of cloth-of-gold flowing from his broad shoulders. his breastplate had a flaming heart inlaid above his own. girding his brows was a red-gold crown with points like twisting flames. val stood beside him, tall and fair. they had crowned her with a simple circlet of dark bronze, yet she looked more regal in bronze than stannis did in gold. her eyes were grey and fearless, unflinching. beneath an ermine cloak, she wore white and gold. her honey-blond hair had been done up in a thick braid that hung over her right shoulder to her waist. the chill in the air had put color in her cheeks. lady melisandre wore no crown, but every man there knew that she was stannis baratheon's real queen, not the homely woman he had left to shiver at eastwatch-by-the-sea. talk was, the king did not mean to send for queen selyse and their daughter until the nightfort was ready for habitation. jon felt sorry for them. the wall offered few of the comforts that southron ladies and little highborn girls were used to, and the night-fort offered none. that was a grim place, even at the best of times. free folk! cried melisandre. behold the fate of those who choose the darkness! the horn of joramun burst into flame. it went up with a whoosh as swirling tongues of green and yellow fire leapt up crackling all along its length. jon's garron shied nervously, and up and down the ranks others fought to still their mounts as well. a moan came from the stockade as the free folk saw their hope afire. a few began to shout and curse, but most lapsed into silence. for half a heartbeat the runes graven on the gold bands seemed to shimmer in the air. the queen's men gave a heave and sent the horn tumbling down into the fire pit. inside his cage, mance rayder clawed at the noose about his neck with bound hands and screamed incoherently of treachery and witchery, denying his kingship, denying his people, denying his name, denying all that he had ever been. he shrieked for mercy and cursed the red woman and began to laugh hysterically. jon watched unblinking. he dare not appear squeamish before his brothers. he had ordered out two hundred men, more than half the garrison of castle black. mounted in solemn sable ranks with tall spears in hand, they had drawn up their hoods to shadow their faces ... and hide the fact that so many were greybeards and green boys. the free folk feared the watch. jon wanted them to take that fear with them to their new homes south of the wall. the horn crashed amongst the logs and leaves and kindling. within three heartbeats the whole pit was aflame. clutching the bars of his cage with bound hands, mance sobbed and begged. when the fire reached him he did a little dance. his screams became one long, wordless shriek of fear and pain. within his cage, he fluttered like a burning leaf, a moth caught in a candle flame. jon found himself remembering a song. brothers, oh brothers, my days here are done, the dornishman's taken my life, but what does it matter, for all men must die, and i've tasted the dornishman's wife! val stood on the platform as still as if she had been carved of salt. she will not weep nor look away. jon wondered what ygritte would have done in her place. the women are the strong ones. he found himself thinking about sam and maester aemon, about gilly and the babe. she will curse me with her dying breath, but i saw no other way. eastwatch reported savage storms upon the narrow sea. / meant to keep them safe. did i feed them to the crabs instead? last night he had dreamed of sam drowning, of ygritte dying with his arrow in her (it had not been his arrow, but in his dreams it always was), of gilly weeping tears of blood. jon snow had seen enough. now, he said. ulmer of the kingswood jammed his spear into the ground, unslung his bow, and slipped a black arrow from his quiver. sweet donnel hill threw back his hood to do the same. garth greyfeather and bearded ben nocked shafts, bent their bows, loosed. one arrow took mance rayder in the chest, one in the gut, one in the throat. the fourth struck one of the cage's wooden bars, and quivered for an instant before catching fire. a woman's sobs echoed off the wall as the wildling king slid bonelessly to the floor of his cage, wreathed in fire. and now his watch is done, jon murmured softly. mance rayder had been a man of the night's watch once, before he changed his black cloak for one slashed with bright red silk. up on the platform, stannis was scowling. jon refused to meet his eyes. the bottom had fallen out of the wooden cage, and its bars were crumbling. every time the fire licked upward, more branches tumbled free, cherry red and black. the lord of light made the sun and moon and stars to light our way, and gave us fire to keep the night at bay, melisandre told the wildlings. none can withstand his flames. none can withstand his flames, the queen's men echoed. the red woman's robes of deep-dyed scarlet swirled about her, and her coppery hair made a halo round her face. tall yellow flames danced from her fingertips like claws. free folk! your false gods cannot help you. your false horn did not save you. your false king brought you only death, despair, defeat ... but here stands the true king. behold his glory! stannis baratheon drew lightbringer. the sword glowed red and yellow and orange, alive with light. jon had seen the show before ... but not like this, never before like this. light-bringer was the sun made steel. when stannis raised the blade above his head, men had to turn their heads or cover their eyes. horses shied, and one threw his rider. the blaze in the fire pit seemed to shrink before this storm of light, like a small dog cowering before a larger one. the wall itself turned red and pink and orange, as waves of color danced across the ice. is this the power of king's blood? westerns has but one king, said stannis. his voice rang harsh, with none of melisandre's music. with this sword i defend my subjects and destroy those who menace them. bend the knee, and i promise you food, land, and justice. kneel and live. or go and die. the choice is yours. he slipped lightbringer into its scabbard, and the world darkened once again, as if the sun had gone behind a cloud. open the gates. open the gates, bellowed ser clayton suggs, in a voice as deep as a warhorn. open the gates, echoed ser corliss penny, commanding the guards. open the gates, cried the serjeants. men scrambled to obey. sharpened stakes were wrenched from the ground, planks were dropped across deep ditches, and the stockade gates were thrown wide. jon snow raised his hand and lowered it, and his black ranks parted right and left, clearing a path to the wall, where dolorous edd tollett pushed open the iron gate. come, urged melisandre. come to the light ... or run back to the darkness. in the pit below her, the fire was crackling. if you choose life, come to me. and they came. slowly at first, some limping or leaning on their fellows, the captives began to emerge from their rough-hewn pen. if you would eat, come to me, jon thought. if you would not freeze or starve, submit. hesitant, wary of some trap, the first few prisoners edged across the planks and through the ring of the stakes, toward melisandre and the wall. more followed, when they saw that no harm had come to those who went before. then more, until it was a steady stream. queen's men in studded jacks and halfhelms handed each passing man, woman, or child a piece of white weirwood: a stick, a splintered branch as pale as broken bone, a spray of blood-red leaves. a piece of the old gods to feed the new. jon flexed the fingers of his sword hand. the heat from the fire pit was palpable even at a distance; for the wild-lings, it had to be blistering. he saw men cringing as they neared the flames, heard children cry. a few turned for the forest. he watched a young woman stumble away with a child on either hand. every few steps she looked back to make certain no one was coming after them, and when she neared the trees she broke into a run. one greybeard took the weir-wood branch they handed him and used it as a weapon, laying about with it until the queen's men converged on him with spears. the others had to step around his body, until ser corliss had it thrown in the fire. more of the free folk chose the woods after that— one in ten, perhaps. but most came on. behind them was only cold and death. ahead was hope. they came on, clutching their scraps of wood until the time came to feed them to the flames. r'hllor was a jealous deity, ever hungry. so the new god devoured the corpse of the old, and cast gigantic shadows of stannis and melisandre upon the wall, black against the ruddy red reflections on the ice. sigorn was the first to kneel before the king. the new magnar of thenn was a younger, shorter version of his father— lean, balding, clad in bronze greaves and a leather shirt sewn with bronze scales. next came rattleshirt in clattering armor made of bones and boiled leather, his helm a giant's skull. under the bones lurked a ruined and wretched creature with cracked brown teeth and a yellow tinge to the whites of his eyes. a small, malicious, treacherous man, as stupid as he is cruel. jon did not believe for a moment that he would keep faith. he wondered what val was feeling as she watched him kneel, forgiven. lesser leaders followed. two clan chiefs of the hornfoot men, whose feet were black and hard. an old wisewoman revered by the peoples of the milkwater. a scrawny dark-eyed boy of two-and-ten, the son of alfyn crowkiller. halleck, brother to harma dogshead, with her pigs. each took a knee before the king. it is too cold for this mummer's show, thought jon. the free folk despise kneelers, he had warned stannis. let them keep their pride, and they will love you better. his grace would not listen. he said, it is swords i need from them, not kisses. having knelt, the wildlings shuffled past the ranks of the black brothers to the gate. jon had detailed horse and satin and half a dozen others to lead them through the wall with torches. on the far side, bowls of hot onion soup awaited them, and chunks of black bread and sausage. clothes as well: cloaks, breeches, boots, tunics, good leather gloves. they would sleep on piles of clean straw, with fires blazing to keep the chill of night at bay. this king was nothing if not methodical. soon or late, however, tormund giantsbane would assault the wall again, and when that hour came jon wondered whose side stannis's new-made subjects would choose. you can give them land and mercy, but the free folk choose their own kings, and it was ma nee they chose, not you. bowen marsh edged his mount up next to jon's. this is a day i never thought to see. the lord steward had thinned notably since suffering a head wound at the bridge of skulls. part of one ear was gone. he no longer looks much like a pomegranate, jon thought. marsh said, we bled to stop the wildlings at the gorge. good men were slain there, friends and brothers. for what? the realm will curse us all for this, declared ser alliser thorne in a venomous tone. every honest man in westerns will turn his head and spit at the mention of the night's watch. what would you know of honest men? quiet in the ranks. ser alliser had grown more circumspect since lord janos had lost his head, but the malice was still there. jon had toyed with the idea of giving him the command slynt had refused, but he wanted the man close. he was always the more dangerous of the two. instead he had dispatched a grizzled steward from the shadow tower to take command at greyguard. he hoped the two new garrisons would make a difference. the watch can make the free folk bleed, but in the end we cannot hope to stop them. giving mance rayder to the fire did not change the truth of that. we are still too few and they are still too many, and without rangers, we're good as blind. i have to send men out. but if i do, will they come back again ? the tunnel through the wall was narrow and twisting, and many of the wildlings were old or ill or wounded, so the going was painfully slow. by the time the last of them had bent the knee, night had fallen. the pit fire was burning low, and the king's shadow on the wall had shrunk to a quarter of its former height. jon snow could see his breath in the air. cold, he thought, and getting colder. this mummer's show has gone on long enough. two score captives lingered by the stockade. four giants were among them, massive hairy creatures with sloped shoulders, legs as large as tree trunks, and huge splayed feet. big as they were, they might still have passed through the wall, but one would not leave his mammoth, and the others would not leave him. the rest of those who remained were all of human stature. some were dead and some were dying; more were their kin or close companions, unwilling to abandon them even for a bowl of onion soup. some shivering, some too numb to shiver, they listened as the king's voice rumbled off the wall. you are free to go, stannis told them. tell your people what you witnessed. tell them that you saw the true king, and that they are welcome in his realm, so long as they keep his peace. else-wise, they had best flee or hide. i will brook no further attacks upon my wall. one realm, one god, one king! cried lady melisandre. the queen's men took up the cry, beating the butts of their spears against their shields. one realm, one god, one king! stannis! stannis! one realm, one god, one king! val did not join the chant, he saw. nor did the brothers of the night's watch. during the tumult the few remaining wildlings melted into the trees. the giants were the last to go, two riding on the back of a mammoth, the other two afoot. only the dead were left behind. jon watched stannis descend from the platform, with melisandre by his side. his red shadow. she never leaves his side for long. the king's honor guard fell in around them— ser godry, ser clayton, and a dozen other knights, queen's men all. moonlight shimmered on their armor and the wind whipped at their cloaks. lord steward, jon told marsh, break up that stockade for firewood and throw the corpses in the fla mes. as my lord commands. marsh barked out orders, and a swarm of his stewards broke from ranks to attack the wooden walls. the lord steward watched them, frowning. these wildlings ... do you think they will keep faith, my lord? some will. not all. we have our cowards and our knaves, our weak-lings and our fools, as do they. our vows ... we are sworn to protect the realm ... once the free folk are settled in the gift, they will become part of the realm, jon pointed out. these are desperate days, and like to grow more desperate. we have seen the face of our real foe, a dead white face with bright blue eyes. the free folk have seen that face as well. stannis is not wrong in this. we must make common cause with the wildlings. common cause against a common foe, i could agree with that, said bowen marsh, but that does not mean we should allow tens of thousands of ha if -starved savages through the wall. let them return to their villages and fight the others there, whilst we seal the gates. it will not be difficult, othell tells me. we need only fill the tunnels with chunks of stone and pour water through the murder holes. the wall does the rest. the cold, the weight ... in a moon's turn, it will be as if no gate had ever been. any foe would need to hack his way through. or climb. unlikely, said bowen marsh. these are not raiders, out to steal a wife and some plunder. tormund will have old women with him, children, herds of sheep and goats, even mammoths. he needs a gate, and only three of those remain. and if he should send climbers up, well, defending against climbers is as simple as spearing fish in a kettle. fish never climb out of the kettle and shove a spear through your belly. jon had climbed the wall himself. marsh went on. mance rayder's bowmen must have loosed ten thousand arrows at us, judging from the number of spent shafts we've gathered up. fewer than a hundred reached our men atop the wall, most of those lifted by some errant gust of wind. red alyn of the rosewood was the only man to die up there, and it was his fall that killed him, not the arrow that pricked his leg. donal noye died to hold the gate. a gallant act, yes ... but if the gate had been sealed, our brave armorer might still be with us. whether we face a hundred foes or a hundred thousand, so long as we're atop the wall and they're below, they cannot do us harm. he's not wrong. mance rayder's host had broken against the wall like a wave upon a stony shore, though the defenders were no more than a handful of old men, green boys, and cripples. yet what bowen was suggesting went against all of jon's instincts. if we seal the gates, we cannot send out rangers, he pointed out. we will be as good as blind. lord mormont's last ranging cost the watch a quarter of its men, my lord. we need to conserve what strength remains us. every death diminishes us, and we are stretched so thin ... take the high ground and win the battle, my uncle used to say. no ground is higher than the wall, lord commander. stannis promises land, food, and justice to any wildlings who bend the knee. he will never permit us to seal the gates. marsh hesitated. lord snow, i am not one to bear tales, but there has been talk that you are becoming too ... too friendly with lord stannis. some even suggest that you are ... a ... a rebel and a turncloak, aye, and a bastard and a warg as well. janos slynt might be gone, but his lies lingered. i know what they say. jon had heard the whispers, had seen men turn away when he crossed the yard. what would they have me do, take up swords against stannis and the wildlings both? his grace has thrice the fighting men we do, and is our guest besides. the laws of hospitality protect him. and we owe him and his a debt. lord stannis helped us when we needed help, marsh said doggedly, but he is still a rebel, and his cause is doomed. as doomed as we'll be if the iron throne marks us down as traitors. we must be certain that we do not choose the losing side. it is not my intent to choose any side, said jon, but i am not as certain of the outcome of this war as you seem to be, my lord. not with lord tywin dead. if the tales coming up the kingsroad could be believed, the king's hand had been murdered by his dwarf son whilst sitting on a privy. jon had known tyrion lannister, briefly. he took my hand and named me friend. it was hard to believe the little man had it in him to murder his own sire, but the fact of lord tywin's demise seemed to be beyond doubt. the lion in king's landing is a cub, and the iron throne has been known to cut grown men to ribbons. a boy he may be, my lord, but ... king robert was well loved, and most men still accept that tommen is his son. the more they see of lord stannis the less they love him, and fewer still are fond of lady melisandre with her fires and this grim red god of hers. they complain. they complained about lord commander mormont too. men love to complain about their wives and lords, he told me once. those without wives complain twice as much about their lords. jon snow glanced toward the stockade. two walls were down, a third falling fast. i will leave you to finish here, bowen. make certain every corpse is burned. thank you for your counsel. i promise you, i will think on all you've said. smoke and drifting ash still lingered in the air about the pit as jon trotted back to the gate. there he dismounted, to walk his garron through the ice to the south side. dolorous edd went before him with a torch. its flames licked the ceiling, so cold tears trickled down upon them with every step. it was a relief to see that horn burn, my lord, edd said. just last night i dreamt i was pissing off the wall when someone decided to give the horn a toot. not that i'm complaining. it was better than my old dream, where harma dogshead was feeding me to her pigs. harma's dead, jon said. but not the pigs. they look at me the way slayer used to look at ham. not to say that the wildlings mean us harm. aye, we hacked their gods apart and made them burn the pieces, but we gave them onion soup. what's a god compared to a nice bowl of onion soup? i could do with one myself. the odors of smoke and burned flesh still clung to jon's blacks. he knew he had to eat, but it was company he craved, not food. a cup of wine with maester aemon, some quiet words with sam, a few laughs with pyp and grenn and toad. aemon and sam were gone, though, and his other friends ... i will take supper with the men this evening. boiled beef and beets. dolorous edd always seemed to know what was cooking. hobb says he's out of horseradish, though. what good is boiled beef without horseradish? since the wildlings had burned the old common hall, the men of the night's watch took their meals in the stone cellar below the armory, a cavernous space divided by two rows of square stone pillars, with barrel-vaulted ceilings and great casks of wine and ale along the walls. when jon entered, four builders were playing at tiles at the table nearest the steps. closer to the fire sat a group of rangers and a few king's men, talking quietly. the younger men were gathered at another table, where pyp had stabbed a turnip with his knife. the night is dark and full of turnips, he announced in a solemn voice. let us all pray for venison, my children, with some onions and a bit of tasty gravy. his friends laughed— grenn, toad, satin, the whole lot of them. jon snow did not join the laughter. making mock of another man's prayer is fool's work, pyp. and dangerous. if the red god's offended, let him strike me down. all the smiles had died. it was the priestess we were laughing at, said satin, a lithe and pretty youth who had once been a whore in oldtown. we were only having a jape, my lord. you have your gods and she has hers. leave her be. she won't let our gods be, argued toad. she calls the seven false gods, m'lord. the old gods too. she made the wildlings burn weirwood branches. you saw. lady melisandre is not part of my command. you are. i won't have bad blood between the king's men and my own. pyp laid a hand on toad's arm. croak no more, brave toad, for our great lord snow has spoken. pyp hopped to his feet and gave jon a mocking bow. i beg pardon. henceforth, i shall not even waggle my ears save by your lordship's lordly leave. he thinks this is all some game. jon wanted to shake some sense into him. waggle your ears all you like. it's your tongue waggling that makes the trouble. i'll see that he's more careful, grenn promised, and i'll clout him if he's not. he hesitated. my lord, will you sup with us? owen, shove over and make room for jon. jon wanted nothing more. no, he had to tell himself, those days are gone. the realization twisted in his belly like a knife. they had chosen him to rule. the wall was his, and their lives were his as well. a lord may love the men that he commands, he could hear his lord father saying, but he cannot be a friend to them. one day he may need to sit in judgment on them, or send them forth to die. another day, the lord commander lied. edd, best see to your own supper. i have work to finish. the outside air seemed even colder than before. across the castle, he could see candlelight shining from the windows of the king's tower. val stood on the tower roof, gazing up at the wall. stannis kept her closely penned in rooms above his own, but he did allow her to walk the battlements for exercise. she looks lonely, jon thought. lonely, and lovely. ygritte had been pretty in her own way, with her red hair kissed by fire, but it was her smile that made her face come alive. val did not need to smile; she would have turned men's heads in any court in the wide world. all the same, the wildling princess was not beloved of her gaolers. she scorned them all as kneelers, and had thrice attempted to escape. when one man-at-arms grew careless in her presence she had snatched his dagger from its sheath and stabbed him in the neck. another inch to the left and he might have died. lonely and lovely and lethal, jon snow reflected, and i might have had her. her, and winterfell, and my lord father's name. instead he had chosen a black cloak and a wall of ice. instead he had chosen honor. a bastard's sort of honor. the wall loomed on his right as he crossed the yard. its high ice glimmered palely, but down below all was shadow. at the gate a dim orange glow shone through the bars where the guards had taken refuge from the wind. jon could hear the creak of chains as the winch cage swung and scraped against the ice. up top, the sentries would be huddling in the warming shed around a brazier, shouting to be heard above the wind. or else they would have given up the effort, and each man would be sunk in his own pool of silence. / should be walking the ice. the wall is mine. he was walking beneath the shell of the lord commander's tower, past the spot where ygritte had died in his arms, when ghost appeared beside him, his warm breath steaming in the cold. in the moonlight, his red eyes glowed like pools of fire. the taste of hot blood filled jon's mouth, and he knew that ghost had killed that night. no, he thought. / am a man, not a wolf. he rubbed his mouth with the back of a gloved hand and spat. clydas still occupied the rooms beneath the rookery. at jon's knock, he came shuffling, a taper in his hand, to open the door a crack. do i intrude? asked jon. not at all. clydas opened the door wider. i was mulling wine. will my lord take a cup? with pleasure. his hands were stiff from cold. he pulled off his gloves and flexed his fingers. clydas returned to the hearth to stir the wine. he's sixty if he's a day. an old man. he only seemed young compared with aemon. short and round, he had the dim pink eyes of some nocturnal creature. a few white hairs clung to his scalp. when clydas poured, jon held the cup with both hands, sniffed the spices, swallowed. the warmth spread through his chest. he drank again, long and deep, to wash the taste of blood from his mouth. the queen's men are saying that the king-beyond-the-wall died craven. that he cried for mercy and denied he was a king. he did. lightbringer was brighter than i'd ever seen it. as bright as the sun. jon raised his cup. to stannis baratheon and his magic sword. the wine was bitter in his mouth. his grace is not an easy man. few are, who wear a crown. many good men have been bad kings, maester aemon used to say, and some bad men have been good kings. he would know. aemon targaryen had seen nine kings upon the iron throne. he had been a king's son, a king's brother, a king's uncle. i looked at that book maester aemon left me. the jade compendium. the pages that told of azor ahai. lightbringer was his sword. tempered with his wife's blood if votar can be believed. thereafter lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as nissa nissa had been warm. in battle the blade burned fiery hot. once azor ahai fought a monster. when he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame. clydas blinked. a sword that makes its own heat ... ... would be a fine thing on the wall. jon put aside his wine cup and drew on his black moleskin gloves. a pity that the sword that stannis wields is cold. i'll be curious to see how his lightbringer behaves in battle. thank you for the wine. ghost, with me. jon snow raised the hood of his cloak and pulled at the door. the white wolf followed him back into the night. the armory was dark and silent. jon nodded to the guards before making his way past the silent racks of spears to his rooms. he hung his sword belt from a peg beside the door and his cloak from another. when he peeled off his gloves, his hands were stiff and cold. it took him a long while to get the candles lit. ghost curled up on his rug and went to sleep, but jon could not rest yet. the scarred pinewood table was covered with maps of the wall and the lands beyond, a roster of rangers, and a letter from the shadow tower written in ser denys mallister's flowing hand. he read the letter from the shadow tower again, sharpened a quill, and unstoppered a pot of thick black ink. he wrote two letters, the first to ser denys, the second to cotter pyke. both of them had been hounding him for more men. haider and toad he dispatched west to the shadow tower, grenn and pyp to eastwatch-by-the-sea. the ink would not flow properly, and all his words seemed curt and crude and clumsy, yet he persisted. when he finally put the quill down, the room was dim and chilly, and he could feel its walls closing in. perched above the window, the old bear's raven peered down at him with shrewd black eyes. my last friend, jon thought ruefully. and i had best outlive you, or you'll eat my face as well. ghost did not count. ghost was closer than a friend. ghost was part of him. jon rose and climbed the steps to the narrow bed that had once been donal noye's. this is my lot, he realized as he undressed, from now until the end of my days. careful of the rats, my lord. dolorous edd led jon down the steps, a lantern in one hand. they make an awful squeal if you step on them. my mother used to make a similar sound when i was a boy. she must have had some rat in her, now that i think of it. brown hair, beady little eyes, liked cheese. might be she had a tail too, i never looked to see. all of castle black was connected underground by a maze of tunnels that the brothers called the wormways. it was dark and gloomy underneath the earth, so the wormways were little used in summer, but when the winter winds began to blow and the snows began to fall, the tunnels became the quickest way to move about the castle. the stewards were making use of them already. jon saw candles burning in several wall niches as they made their way along the tunnel, their footsteps echoing ahead of them. bowen marsh was waiting at a junction where four wormways met. with him he had wick whittlestick, tall and skinny as a spear. these are the counts from three turns ago, marsh told jon, offering him a thick sheaf of papers, for comparison with our present stores. shall we start with the granaries? they moved through the grey gloom beneath the earth. each storeroom had a solid oaken door closed with an iron padlock as big as a supper plate. is pilferage a problem? jon asked. not as yet, said bowen marsh. once winter comes, though, your lordship might be wise to post guards down here. wick whittlestick wore the keys on a ring about his neck. they all looked alike to jon, yet somehow wick found the right one for every door. once inside, he would take a fist -sized chunk of chalk from his pouch and mark each cask and sack and barrel as he counted them while marsh compared the new count to the old. in the granaries were oats and wheat and barley, and barrels of coarse ground flour. in the root cellars strings of onions and garlic dangled from the rafters, and bags of carrots, parsnips, radishes, and white and yellow turnips filled the shelves. one storeroom held wheels of cheese so large it took two men to move them. in the next, casks of salt beef, salt pork, salt mutton, and salt cod were stacked ten feet high. three hundred hams and three thousand long black sausages hung from ceiling beams below the smokehouse. in the spice locker they found peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon, mustard seeds, coriander, sage and clary sage and parsley, blocks of salt. elsewhere were casks of apples and pears, dried peas, dried figs, bags of walnuts, bags of chestnuts, bags of almonds, planks of dry smoked salmon, clay jars packed with olives in oil and sealed with wax. one storeroom offered potted hare, haunch of deer in honey, pickled cabbage, pickled beets, pickled onions, pickled eggs, and pickled herring. as they moved from one vault to another, the wormways seemed to grow colder. before long jon could see their breath frosting in the lantern light. we're beneath the wall. and soon inside it, said marsh. the meat won't spoil in the cold. for long storage, it's better than salting. the next door was made of rusty iron. behind it was a flight of wooden steps. dolorous edd led the way with his lantern. up top they found a tunnel as long as winterfell's great hall though no wider than the worm-ways. the walls were ice, bristling with iron hooks. from each hook hung a carcass: skinned deer and elk, sides of beef, huge sows swinging from the ceiling, headless sheep and goats, even horse and bear. hoarfrost covered everything. as they did their count, jon peeled the glove off his left hand and touched the nearest haunch of venison. he could feel his fingers sticking, and when he pulled them back he lost a bit of skin. his fingertips were numb. what did you expect? there's a mountain of ice above your head, more tons than even bowen marsh could count. even so, the room felt colder than it should. it is worse than i feared, my lord, marsh announced when he was done. he sounded gloomier than dolorous edd. jon had just been thinking that all the meat in the world surrounded them. you know nothing, jon snow. how so? this seems a deal of food to me. it was a long summer. the harvests were bountiful, the lords generous. we had enough laid by to see us through three years of winter. four, with a bit of scrimping. now, though, if we must go on feeding all these king's men and queen's men and wildlings ... mole's town alone has a thousand useless mouths, and still they come. three more turned up yesterday at the gates, a dozen the day before. it cannot go on. settling them on the gift, that's well and good, but it is too late to plant crops. we'll be down to turnips and pease porridge before the year is out. after that we'll be drinking the blood of our own horses. yum, declared dolorous edd. nothing beats a hot cup of horse blood on a cold night. i like mine with a pinch of cinnamon sprinkled on top. the lord steward paid him no mind. there will be sickness too, he went on, bleeding gums and loose teeth. maester aemon used to say that lime juice and fresh meat would remedy that, but our limes were gone a year ago and we do not have enough fodder to keep herds afoot for fresh meat. we should butcher all but a few breeding pairs. it's past time. in winters past, food could be brought up the kingsroad from the south, but with the war ... it is still autumn, i know, but i would advise we go on winter rations nonetheless, if it please my lord. the men will love that. if we must. we'll cut each man's portion by a quarter. if my brothers are complaining of me now, what will they say when they're eating snow and acorn paste? that will help, my lord. the lord steward's tone made it plain that he did not think that it would help enough. dolorous edd said, now i understand why king stannis let the wild-lings through the wall. he means for us to eat them. jon had to smile. it will not come to that. oh, good, said edd. they look a stringy lot, and my teeth are not as sharp as when i was younger. if we had sufficient coin, we could buy food from the south and bring it in by ship, the lord steward said. we could, thought jon, if we had the gold, and someone willing to sell us food. both of those were lacking. our best hope may be the eyrie. the vale of arryn was famously fertile and had gone untouched during the fighting. jon wondered how lady catelyn's sister would feel about feeding ned stark's bastard. as a boy, he often felt as if the lady grudged him every bite. we can always hunt if need be, wick whittlestick put in. there's still game in the woods. and wildlings, and darker things, said marsh. i would not send out hunters, my lord. i would not. no. you would close our gates forever and seal them up with stone and ice. half of castle black agreed with the lord steward's views, he knew. the other half heaped scorn on them. seal our gates and plant your fat black arses on the wall, aye, and the free folk'll come swarming o'er the bridge o' skulls or through some gate you thought you'd sealed five hundred years ago, the old forester dywen had declared loudly over supper, two nights past. we don't have the men to watch a hundred leagues o' wall. tormund giantsbutt and the bloody weeper knows it too. ever see a duck frozen in a pond, with his feet in the ice? it works the same for crows. most rangers echoed dywen, whilst the stewards and builders inclined toward bowen marsh. but that was a quandary for another day. here and now, the problem was food. we cannot leave king stannis and his men to starve, even if we wished to, jon said. if need be, he could simply take all this at sword-point. we do not have the men to stop them. the wildlings must be fed as well. how, my lord? asked bowen marsh. would that i knew. we will find a way. by the time they returned to the surface, the shadows of the afternoon were growing long. clouds streaked the sky like tattered banners, grey and white and torn. the yard outside the armory was empty, but inside jon found the king's squire awaiting him. devan was a skinny lad of some twelve years, brown of hair and eye. they found him frozen by the forge, hardly daring to move as ghost sniffed him up and down. he won't hurt you, jon said, but the boy flinched at the sound of his voice, and that sudden motion made the direwolf bare his teeth. no! jon said. ghost, leave him be. away. the wolf slunk back to his ox bone, silence on four feet. devan looked as pale as ghost, his face damp with perspiration. m-my lord. his grace c-commands your presence. the boy was clad in baratheon gold and black, with the flaming heart of a queen's man sewn above his own. you mean requests, said dolorous edd. his grace requests the presence of the lord commander. that's how i'd say it. leave it be, edd. jon was in no mood for such squabbles. sir richard and ser justin have returned, said devan. will you come, my lord? the wrong-way rangers. massey and horpe had ridden south, not north. whatever they had learned did not concern the night's watch, but jon was curious all the same. if it would please his grace. he followed the young squire back across the yard. ghost padded after them until jon said, no. stay! instead the direwolf ran off. in the king's tower, jon was stripped of his weapons and admitted to the royal presence. the solar was hot and crowded. stannis and his captains were gathered over the map of the north. the wrong-way rangers were amongst them. sigorn was there as well, the young magnar of thenn, clad in a leather hauberk sewn with bronze scales. rattleshirt sat scratching at the manacle on his wrist with a cracked yellow fingernail. brown stubble covered his sunken cheeks and receding chin, and strands of dirty hair hung across his eyes. here he comes, he said when he saw jon, the brave boy who slew mance rayder when he was caged and bound. the big square-cut gem that adorned his iron cuff glimmered redly. do you like my ruby, snow? a token o' love from lady red. jon ignored him and took a knee. your grace, announced the squire devan, i've brought lord snow. i can see that. lord commander. you know my knights and captains, i believe. i have that honor. he had made it a point to learn all he could of the men around the king. queen's men, all. it struck jon as odd that there were no king's men about the king, but that seemed to be the way of it. the king's men had incurred stannis's ire on dragonstone if the talk jon heard was true. there is wine. or water boiled with lemons. thank you, but no. as you wish. i have a gift for you, lord snow. the king waved a hand at rattleshirt. him. lady melisandre smiled. you did say you wanted men, lord snow. i believe our lord of bones still qualifies. jon was aghast. your grace, this man cannot be trusted. if i keep him here, someone will slit his throat for him. if i send him ranging, he'll just go back over to the wildlings. not me. i'm done with those bloody fools. rattleshirt tapped the ruby on his wrist. ask your red witch, bastard. melisandre spoke softly in a strange tongue. the ruby at her throat throbbed slowly, and jon saw that the smaller stone on rattleshirt's wrist was brightening and darkening as well. so long as he wears the gem he is bound to me, blood and soul, the red priestess said. this man will serve you faithfully. the flames do not lie, lord snow. perhaps not, jon thought, but you do. i'll range for you, bastard, rattleshirt declared. i'll give you sage counsel or sing you pretty songs, as you prefer. i'll even fight for you. just don't ask me to wear your cloak. you are not worthy of one, jon thought, but he held his tongue. no good would come of squabbling before the king. king stannis said, lord snow, tell me of mors umber. the night's watch takes no part, jon thought, but another voice within him said, words are not swords. the elder of the greatjon's uncles. crow-food, they call him. a crow once took him for dead and pecked out his eye. he caught the bird in his fist and bit its head off. when mors was young he was a fearsome fighter. his sons died on the trident, his wife in childbed. his only daughter was carried off by wildlings thirty years ago. that's why he wants the head, said harwood fell. can this man mors be trusted? asked stannis. has mors umber bent the knee? your grace should have him swear an oath before his heart tree. godry the giantslayer guffawed. i had forgotten that you northmen worship trees. what sort of god lets himself be pissed upon by dogs? asked farring's crony clayton suggs. jon chose to ignore them. your grace, might i know if the umbers have declared for you? half of them, and only if i meet this crowfood's price, said stannis, in an irritated tone. he wants mance rayder's skull for a drinking cup, and he wants a pardon for his brother, who has ridden south to join bolton. whoresbane, he's called. ser godry was amused by that as well. what names these northmen have! did this one bite the head off some whore? jon regarded him coolly. you might say so. a whore who tried to rob him, fifty years ago in oldtown. odd as it might seem, old hoarfrost umber had once believed his youngest son had the makings of a maester. mors loved to boast about the crow who took his eye, but hother's tale was only told in whispers ... most like because the whore he'd disemboweled had been a man. have other lords declared for bolton too? the red priestess slid closer to the king. i saw a town with wooden walls and wooden streets, filled with men. banners flew above its walls: a moose, a battle-axe, three pine trees, longaxes crossed beneath a crown, a horse's head with fiery eyes. hornwood, cerwyn, tallhart, ryswell, and dustin, supplied ser clayton suggs. traitors, all. lapdogs of the lannisters. the ryswells and dustins are tied to house bolton by marriage, jon informed him. these others have lost their lords in the fighting. i do not know who leads them now. crowfood is no lapdog, though. your grace would do well to accept his terms. stannis ground his teeth. he informs me that umber will not fight umber, for any cause. jon was not surprised. if it comes to swords, see where hother's banner flies and put mors on the other end of the line. the giantslayer disagreed. you would make his grace look weak. i say, show our strength. burn last hearth to the ground and ride to war with crowfood's head mounted on a spear, as a lesson to the next lord who presumes to offer half his homage. a fine plan if what you want is every hand in the north raised against you. half is more than none. the umbers have no love for the boltons. if whoresbane has joined the bastard, it can only be because the lannisters hold the greatjon captive. that is his pretext, not his reason, declared ser godry. if the nephew dies in chains, these uncles can claim his lands and lordship for themselves. the greatjon has sons and daughters both. in the north the children of a man's body still come before his uncles, ser. unless they die. dead children come last everywhere. suggest that in the hearing of mors umber, ser godry, and you will learn more of death than you might wish. i have slain a giant, boy. why should i fear some flea-ridden north-man who paints one on his shield? the giant was running away. mors won't be. the big knight flushed. you have a bold tongue in the king's solar, boy. in the yard you sang a different song. oh, leave off, godry, said ser justin massey, a loose-limbed, fleshy knight with a ready smile and a mop of flaxen hair. massey had been one of the wrong-way rangers. we all know what a big giant sword you have, i'm sure. no need for you to wave it in our faces yet again. the only thing waving here is your tongue, massey. be quiet, stannis snapped. lord snow, attend me. i have lingered here in the hopes that the wildlings would be fool enough to mount another attack upon the wall. as they will not oblige me, it is time i dealt with my other foes. i see. jon's tone was wary. what does he want of me? i have no love for lord bolton or his son, but the night's watch cannot take up arms against them. our vows prohibit— i know all about your vows. spare me your rectitude, lord snow, i have strength enough without you. i have a mind to march against the dreadfort. when he saw the shock on jon's face, he smiled. does that surprise you? good. what surprises one snow may yet surprise another. the bastard of bolton has gone south, taking hother umber with him. on that mors umber and arnolf karstark are agreed. that can only mean a strike at moat cailin, to open the way for his lord father to return to the north. the bastard must think i am too busy with the wildlings to trouble him. well and good. the boy has shown me his throat. i mean to rip it out. roose bolton may regain the north, but when he does he will find that his castle, herds, and harvest all belong to me. if i take the dreadfort unawares— you won't, jon blurted. it was as if he whacked a wasps' nest with a stick. one of the queen's men laughed, one spat, one muttered a curse, and the rest all tried to talk at once. the boy has milkwater in his veins, said ser godry the giant-slayer. and lord sweet huffed, the craven sees an outlaw behind every blade of grass. stannis raised a hand for silence. explain your meaning. where to begin? jon moved to the map. candles had been placed at its corners to keep the hide from rolling up. a finger of warm wax was puddling out across the bay of seals, slow as a glacier. to reach the dreadfort, your grace must travel down the kingsroad past the last river, turn south by east and cross the lonely hills. he pointed. those are umber lands, where they know every tree and every rock. the kingsroad runs along their western marches for a hundred leagues. mors will cut your host to pieces unless you meet his terms and win him to your cause. very well. let us say i do that. that will bring you to the dreadfort, said jon, but unless your host can outmarch a raven or a line of beacon fires, the castle will know of your approach. it will be an easy thing for ramsay bolton to cut off your retreat and leave you far from the wall, without food or refuge, surrounded by your foes. only if he abandons his siege of moat cailin. moat cailin will fall before you ever reach the dreadfort. once lord roose has joined his strength to ramsay's, they will have you outnumbered five to one. my brother won battles at worse odds. you assume moat cailin will fall quickly, snow, objected justin massey, but the ironmen are doughty fighters, and i've heard it said that the moat has never been taken. from the south. a small garrison in moat cailin can play havoc with any army coming up the causeway, but the ruins are vulnerable from the north and east. jon turned back to stannis. sire, this is a bold stroke, but the risk— the night's watch takes no part. baratheon or bolton should be the same to me. if roose bolton should catch you beneath his walls with his main strength, it will be the end for all of you. risk is part of war, declared ser richard horpe, a lean knight with a ravaged face whose quilted doublet showed three death's-head moths on a field of ash and bone. every battle is a gamble, snow. the man who does nothing also takes a risk. there are risks and risks, ser richard. this one ... it is too much, too soon, too far away. i know the dreadfort. it is a strong castle, all of stone, with thick walls and massive towers. with winter coming you will find it well provisioned. centuries ago, house bolton rose up against the king in the north, and harlon stark laid siege to the dreadfort. it took him two years to starve them out. to have any hope of taking the castle, your grace would need siege engines, towers, battering rams ... siege towers can be raised if need be, stannis said. trees can be felled for rams if rams are required. arnolf karstark writes that fewer than fifty men remain at the dreadfort, half of them servants. a strong castle weakly held is weak. fifty men inside a castle are worth five hundred outside. that depends upon the men, said richard horpe. these will be greybeards and green boys, the men this bastard did not deem fit for battle. our own men were blooded and tested on the blackwater, and they are led by knights. you saw how we went through the wildlings. ser justin pushed back a lock of flaxen hair. the karstarks have sworn to join us at the dreadfort, and we will have our wildlings as well. three hundred men of fighting age. lord harwood made a count as they were passing through the gate. their women fight as well. stannis gave him a sour look. not for me, ser. i want no widows wailing in my wake. the women will remain here, with the old, the wounded, and the children. they will serve as hostages for the loyalty of their husbands and fathers. the wildling men will form my van. the magnar will command them, with their own chiefs as serjeants. first, though, we must needs arm them. he means to plunder our armory, jon realized. food and clothing, land and castles, now weapons. he draws me in deeper every day. words might not be swords, but swords were swords. i could find three hundred spears/' he said, reluctantly. helms as well, if you'll take them old and dinted and red with rust. armor? asked the magnar. plate? mail? when donal noye died we lost our armorer. the rest jon left unspoken. give the wildlings mail and they'll be twice as great a danger to the realm. boiled leather will suffice, said ser godry. once we've tasted battle, the survivors can loot the dead. the few who live that long. if stannis placed the free folk in the van, most would perish quickly. drinking from mance rayder's skull may give mors umber pleasure, but seeing wildlings cross his lands will not. the free folk have been raiding the umbers since the dawn of days, crossing the bay of seals for gold and sheep and women. one of those carried off was crowfood's daughter. your grace, leave the wildlings here. taking them will only serve to turn my lord father's bannermen against you. your father's bannermen seem to have no liking for my cause in any case. i must assume they see me as ... what was it that you called me, lord snow? another doomed pretender? stannis stared at the map. for a long moment the only sound was the king grinding his teeth. leave me. all of you. lord snow, remain. the brusque dismissal did not sit well with justin massey, but he had no choice but to smile and withdraw. horpe followed him out, after giving jon a measured look. clayton suggs drained his cup dry and muttered something to harwood fell that made the younger man laugh. boy was part of it. suggs was an upjumped hedge knight, as crude as he was strong. the last man to take his leave was rattleshirt. at the door, he gave jon a mocking bow, grinning through a mouthful of brown and broken teeth. all of you did not seem to include lady melisandre. the king's red shadow. stannis called to devan for more lemon water. when his cup was filled the king drank, and said, horpe and massey aspire to your father's seat. massey wants the wildling princess too. he once served my brother robert as squire and acquired his appetite for female flesh. horpe will take val to wife if i command it, but it is battle he lusts for. as a squire he dreamed of a white cloak, but cersei lannister spoke against him and robert passed him over. perhaps rightly. ser richard is too fond of killing. which would you have as lord of winterfell, snow? the smiler or the slayer? jon said, winterfell belongs to my sister sansa. i have heard all i need to hear of lady lannister and her claim. the king set the cup aside. you could bring the north to me. your father's bannermen would rally to the son of eddard stark. even lord too-fat-to-sit-a-horse. white harbor would give me a ready source of supply and a secure base to which i could retreat at need. it is not too late to amend your folly, snow. take a knee and swear that bastard sword to me, and rise as jon stark, lord of winterfell and warden of the north. how many times will he make me say it? my sword is sworn to the night's watch. stannis looked disgusted. your father was a stubborn man as well. honor, he called it. well, honor has its costs, as lord eddard learned to his sorrow. if it gives you any solace, horpe and massey are doomed to disappointment. i am more inclined to bestow winterfell upon arnolf karstark. a good northman. a northman. better a karstark than a bolton or a greyjoy, jon told himself, but the thought gave him little solace. the karstarks abandoned my brother amongst his enemies. after your brother took off lord rickard's head. arnolf was a thousand leagues away. he has stark blood in him. the blood of winterfell. no more than half the other houses of the north. those other houses have not declared for me. arnolf karstark is an old man with a crooked back, and even in his youth he was never the fighter lord rickard was. the rigors of the campaign may well kill him. he has heirs, stannis snapped. two sons, six grandsons, some daughters. if robert had fathered trueborn sons, many who are dead might still be living. your grace would do better with mors crowfood. the dreadfort will be the proof of that. then you mean to go ahead with this attack? despite the counsel of the great lord snow? aye. horpe and massey may be ambitious, but they are not wrong. i dare not sit idle whilst roose bolton's star waxes and mine wanes. i must strike and show the north that i am still a man to fear. the merman of manderly was not amongst those banners lady melisandre saw in her fires, jon said. if you had white harbor and lord wyman's knights ... //is a word for fools. we have had no word from davos. it may be he never reached white harbor. arnolf karstark writes that the storms have been fierce upon the narrow sea. be that as it may. i have no time to grieve, nor wait upon the whims of lord too-fat. i must consider white harbor lost to me. without a son of winterfell to stand beside me, i can only hope to win the north by battle. that requires stealing a leaf from my brother's book. not that robert ever read one. i must deal my foes a mortal blow before they know that i am on them. jon realized that his words were wasted. stannis would take the dreadfort or die in the attempt. the night's watch takes no part, a voice said, but another replied, stannis fights for the realm, the ironmen for thralls and plunder. your grace, i know where you might find more men. give me the wildlings, and i will gladly tell you where and how. i gave you rattleshirt. be content with him. i want them all. some of your own sworn brothers would have me believe that you are half a wildling yourself. is it true? to you they are only arrow fodder. i can make better use of them upon the wall. give them to me to do with as i will, and i'll show you where to find your victory ... and men as well. stannis rubbed the back of his neck. you haggle like a crone with a codfish, lord snow. did ned stark father you on some fishwife? how many men? two thousand. perhaps three. three thousand? what manner of men are these? proud. poor. prickly where their honor is concerned but fierce fighters. this had best not be some bastard's trick. will i trade three hundred fighters for three thousand? aye, i will. i am not an utter fool. if i leave the girl with you as well, do i have your word that you will keep our princess closely? she is not a princess. as you wish, your grace. do i need to make you swear an oath before a tree? no. was that a jape? with stannis, it was hard to tell. done, then. now, where are these men? you'll find them here. jon spread his burned hand across the map, west of the kingsroad and south of the gift. those mountains? stannis grew suspicious. i see no castles marked there. no roads, no towns, no villages. the map is not the land, my father often said. men have lived in the high valleys and mountain meadows for thousands of years, ruled by their clan chiefs. petty lords, you would call them, though they do not use such titles amongst themselves. clan champions fight with huge two-handed greatswords, while the common men sling stones and batter one another with staffs of mountain ash. a quarrelsome folk, it must be said. when they are not fighting one another, they tend their herds, fish the bay of ice, and breed the hardiest mounts you'll ever ride. and they will fight for me, you believe? if you ask them. why should i beg for what is owed me? ask, i said, not beg. jon pulled back his hand. it is no good sending messages. your grace will need to go to them yourself. eat their bread and salt, drink their ale, listen to their pipers, praise the beauty of their daughters and the courage of their sons, and you'll have their swords. the clans have not seen a king since torrhen stark bent his knee. your coming does them honor. command them to fight for you, and they will look at one another and say, 'who is this man? he is no king of mine.'  how many clans are you speaking of? two score, small and large. flint, wull, norrey, liddle ... win old flint and big bucket, the rest will follow. big bucket? the wull. he has the biggest belly in the mountains, and the most men. the wulls fish the bay of ice and warn their little ones that ironmen will carry them off if they don't behave. to reach them your grace must pass through the norrey's lands, however. they live the nearest to the gift and have always been good friends to the watch. i could give you guides. could? stannis missed little. or will? will. you'll need them. and some sure-footed garrons too. the paths up there are little more than goat tracks. goat tracks? the king's eyes narrowed. i speak of moving swiftly, and you waste my time with goof tracks? when the young dragon conquered dome, he used a goat track to bypass the dornish watchtowers on the boneway. i know that tale as well, but daeron made too much of it in that vain-glorious book of his. ships won that war, not goat tracks. oakenfist broke the planky town and swept halfway up the greenblood whilst the main dornish strength was engaged in the prince's pass. stannis drummed his fingers on the map. these mountain lords will not hinder my passage? only with feasts. each will try to outdo the others with his hospitality. my lord father said he never ate half so well as when visiting the clans. for three thousand men, i suppose i can endure some pipes and porridge, the king said, though his tone begrudged even that. jon turned to melisandre. my lady, fair warning. the old gods are strong in those mountains. the clansmen will not suffer insults to their heart trees. that seemed to amuse her. have no fear, jon snow, i will not trouble your mountain savages and their dark gods. my place is here with you and your brave brothers. that was the last thing jon snow would have wanted, but before he could object, the king said, where would you have me lead these stalwarts if not against the dreadfort? jon glanced down at the map. deepwood motte. he tapped it with a finger. if bolton means to fight the ironmen, so must you. deepwood is a motte-and-bailey castle in the midst of thick forest, easy to creep up on unawares. a wooden castle, defended by an earthen dike and a palisade of logs. the going will be slower through the mountains, admittedly, but up there your host can move unseen, to emerge almost at the gates of deepwood. stannis rubbed his jaw. when balon greyjoy rose the first time, i beat the ironmen at sea, where they are fiercest. on land, taken unawares ... aye. i have won a victory over the wildlings and their king-beyond-the-wall. if i can smash the ironmen as well, the north will know it has a king again. and i will have a thousand wildlings, thought jon, and no way to feed even half that number. his candle had guttered out in a pool of wax, but morning light was shining through the shutters of his window. jon had fallen asleep over his work again. books covered his table, tall stacks of them. he'd fetched them up himself, after spending half the night searching through dusty vaults by lantern light. sam was right, the books desperately needed to be sorted, listed, and put in order, but that was no task for stewards who could neither read nor write. it would need to wait for sam's return. if he does return. jon feared for sam and maester aemon. cotter pyke had written from eastwatch to report that the storm crow had sighted the wreckage of a galley along the coast of skagos. whether the broken ship was blackbird, one of stannis baratheon's sellsails, or some passing trader, the crew of the storm crow had not been able to discern. / meant to send gilly and the babe to safety. did i send them to their graves instead? last night's supper had congealed beside his elbow, scarce touched. dolorous edd had filled his trencher almost to overflowing to allow three-finger hobb's infamous three-meat stew to soften the stale bread. the jest among the brothers was that the three meats were mutton, mutton, and mutton, but carrot, onion, and turnip would have been closer to the mark. a film of cold grease glistened atop the remains of the stew. bowen marsh had urged him to move into the old bear's former chambers in the king's tower after stannis vacated them, but jon had declined. moving into the king's chambers could too easily be taken to mean he did not expect the king to return. a strange listlessness had settled over castle black since stannis had marched south, as if the free folk and the black brothers alike were holding their breath, waiting to see what would come. the yards and dining hall were empty more oft than not, the lord commander's tower was a shell, the old common hall a pile of blackened timbers, and hardin's tower looked as if the next gust of wind would knock it over. the only sound of life that jon could hear was the faint clash of swords coming from the yard outside the armory. iron emmett was shouting at hop-robin to keep his shield up. we had all best keep our shields up. jon washed and dressed and left the armory, stopping in the yard outside just long enough to say a few words of encouragement to hop-robin and emmett's other charges. he declined ty's offer of a tail, as usual. he would have men enough about him; if it came to blood, two more would hardly matter. he did take longclaw, though, and ghost followed at his heels. by the time he reached the stable, dolorous edd had the lord commander's palfrey saddled and bridled and waiting for him. the wayns were forming up beneath bowen marsh's watchful eye. the lord steward was trotting down the column, pointing and fussing, his cheeks red from the cold. when he spied jon, they reddened even more. lord commander. are you still intent on this ... ... folly? finished jon. please tell me you were not about to say folly, my lord. yes, i am. we have been over this. eastwatch wants more men. the shadow tower wants more men. greyguard and icemark as well, i have no doubt, and we have fourteen other castles still sitting empty, long leagues of wall that remain unwatched and undefended. marsh pursed his lips. lord commander mormont—  —is dead. and not at wildling hands, but at the hands of his own sworn brothers, men he trusted. neither you nor i can know what he would or would not have done in my place. jon wheeled his horse around. enough talk. away. dolorous edd had heard the entire exchange. as bowen marsh trotted off, he nodded toward his back and said, pomegranates. all those seeds. a man could choke to death. i'd sooner have a turnip. never knew a turnip to do a man any harm. it was at times like this that jon missed maester aemon the most. clydas tended to the ravens well enough, but he had not a tenth of aemon targaryen's knowledge or experience, and even less of his wisdom. bowen was a good man in his way, but the wound he had taken at the bridge of skulls had hardened his attitudes, and the only song he ever sang now was his familiar refrain about sealing the gates. othell yarwyck was as stolid and unimaginative as he was taciturn, and the first rangers seemed to die as quick as they were named. the night's watch has lost too many of its best men, jon reflected, as the wagons began to move. the old bear, qhorin halfhand, donal noye, jarmen buckwell, my uncle ... a light snow began to fall as the column made its way south along the kingsroad, the long line of wagons wending past fields and streams and wooded hillsides, with a dozen spearmen and a dozen archers riding escort. the last few trips had seen some ugliness at mole's town, a little pushing and shoving, some muttered curses, a lot of sullen looks. bowen marsh felt it best not to take chances, and for once he and jon were agreed. the lord steward led the way. jon rode a few yards back, dolorous edd tollett at his side. half a mile south of castle black, edd urged his garron close to jon's and said, m'lord? look up there. the big drunkard on the hill. the drunkard was an ash tree, twisted sideways by centuries of wind. and now it had a face. a solemn mouth, a broken branch for a nose, two eyes carved deep into the trunk, gazing north up the kingsroad, toward the castle and the wall. the wildlings brought their gods with them after all. jon was not surprised. men do not give up their gods so easily. the whole pageant that lady melisandre had orchestrated beyond the wall suddenly seemed as empty as a mummer's farce. looks a bit like you, edd, he said, trying to make light of it. aye, m'lord. i don't have leaves growing out my nose, but else-wise ... lady melisandre won't be happy. she's not like to see it. see that no one tells her. she sees things in those fires, though. smoke and cinders. and people burning. me, most like. with leaves up my nose. i always feared i'd burn, but i was hoping to die first. jon glanced back at the face, wondering who had carved it. he had posted guards around mole's town, both to keep his crows away from the wildling women and to keep the free folk from slipping off southward to raid. whoever had carved up the ash had eluded his sentries, plainly. and if one man could slip through the cordon, others could as well. / could double the guard again, he thought sourly. waste twice as many men, men who might otherwise be walking the wall. the wagons continued on their slow way south through frozen mud and blowing snow. a mile farther on, they came upon a second face, carved into a chestnut tree that grew beside an icy stream, where its eyes could watch the old plank bridge that spanned its flow. twice as much trouble, announced dolorous edd. the chestnut was leafless and skeletal, but its bare brown limbs were not empty. on a low branch overhanging the stream a raven sat hunched, its feathers ruffled up against the cold. when it spied jon it spread its wings and gave a scream. when he raised his fist and whistled, the big black bird came flapping down, crying, corn, corn, corn. corn for the free folk, jon told him. none for you. he wondered if they would all be reduced to eating ravens before the coming winter had run its course. the brothers on the wagons had seen this face as well, jon did not doubt. no one spoke of it, but the message was plain to read for any man with eyes. jon had once heard mance rayder say that most kneelers were sheep. now, a dog can herd a flock of sheep, the king-beyond-the-wall had said, but free folk, well, some are shadowcats and some are stones. one kind prowls where they please and will tear your dogs to pieces. the other will not move at all unless you kick them. neither shadowcats nor stones were like to give up the gods they had worshiped all their lives to bow down before one they hardly knew. just north of mole's town they came upon the third watcher, carved into the huge oak that marked the village perimeter, its deep eyes fixed upon the kingsroad. that is not a friendly face, jon snow reflected. the faces that the first men and the children of the forest had carved into the weirwoods in eons past had stern or savage visages more oft than not, but the great oak looked especially angry, as if it were about to tear its roots from the earth and come roaring after them. its wounds are as fresh as the wounds of the men who carved it. mole's town had always been larger than it seemed; most of it was underground, sheltered from the cold and snow. that was more true than ever now. the magnar of thenn had put the empty village to the torch when he passed through on his way to attack castle black, and only heaps of blackened beams and old scorched stones remained aboveground ... but down beneath the frozen earth, the vaults and tunnels and deep cellars still endured, and that was where the free folk had taken refuge, huddled together in the dark like the moles from which the village took its name. the wagons drew up in a crescent in front of what had once been the village smithy. nearby a swarm of red-faced children were building a snow fort, but they scattered at the sight of the black-cloaked brothers, vanishing down one hole or another. a few moments later the adults began to emerge from the earth. a stench came with them, the smell of unwashed bodies and soiled clothing, of nightsoil and urine. jon saw one of his men wrinkle his nose and say something to the man beside him. some jape about the smell of freedom, he guessed. too many of his brothers were making japes about the stench of the savages in mole's town. pig ignorance, jon thought. the free folk were no different than the men of the night's watch; some were clean, some dirty, but most were clean at times and dirty at other times. this stink was just the smell of a thousand people jammed into cellars and tunnels that had been dug to shelter no more than a hundred. the wildlings had done this dance before. wordless, they formed up in lines behind the wagons. there were three women for every man, many with children— pale skinny things clutching at their skirts. jon saw very few babes in arms. the babes in arms died during the march, he realized, and those who survived the battle died in the king's stockade. the fighters had fared better. three hundred men of fighting age, justin massey had claimed in council. lord harwood fell had counted them. there will be spearwives too. fifty, sixty, maybe as many as a hundred. fell's count had included men who had suffered wounds, jon knew. he saw a score of those— men on crude crutches, men with empty sleeves and missing hands, men with one eye or half a face, a legless man carried between two friends. and every one grey-faced and gaunt. broken men, he thought. the wights are not the only sort of living dead. not all the fighting men were broken, though. half a dozen thenns in bronze scale armor stood clustered round one cellar stair, watching sullenly and making no attempt to join the others. in the ruins of the old village smithy jon spied a big bald slab of a man he recognized as halleck, the brother of harma dogshead. harma's pigs were gone, though. eaten, no doubt. those two in furs were hornfoot men, as savage as they were scrawny, barefoot even in the snow. there are wolves amongst these sheep, still. val had reminded him of that, on his last visit with her. free folk and kneelers are more alike than not, jon snow. men are men and women women, no matter which side of the wall we were born on. good men and bad, heroes and villains, men of honor, liars, cravens, brutes ... we have plenty, as do you. she was not wrong. the trick was telling one from the other, parting the sheep from the goats. the black brothers began to pass out food. they'd brought slabs of hard salt beef, dried cod, dried beans, turnips, carrots, sacks of barley meal and wheaten flour, pickled eggs, barrels of onions and apples. you can have an onion or an apple, jon heard hairy hal tell one woman, but not both. you got to pick. the woman did not seem to understand. i need two of each. one o' each for me, t' others for my boy. he's sick, but an apple will set him right. hal shook his head. he has to come get his own apple. or his onion. not both. same as you. now, is it an apple or an onion? be quick about it, now, there's more behind you. an apple, she said, and he gave her one, an old dried thing, small and withered. move along, woman, shouted a man three places back. it's cold out here. the woman paid the shout no mind. another apple/' she said to hairy hal. for my son. please. this one is so little. hal looked to jon. jon shook his head. they would be out of apples soon enough. if they started giving two to everyone who wanted two, the latecomers would get none. out of the way, a girl behind the woman said. then she shoved her in the back. the woman staggered, lost her apple, and fell. the other foodstuffs in her arms went flying. beans scattered, a turnip rolled into a mud puddle, a sack of flour split and spilled its precious contents in the snow. angry voices rose, in the old tongue and the common. more shoving broke out at another wagon. it's not enough, an old man snarled. you bloody crows are starving us to death. the woman who'd been knocked down was scrabbling on her knees after her food. jon saw the flash of naked steel a few yards away. his own bowmen nocked arrows to their strings. he turned in his saddle. rory. quiet them. rory lifted his great horn to his lips and blew. aaaahooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. the tumult and the shoving died. heads turned. a child began to cry. mormont's raven walked from jon's left shoulder to his right, bobbing its head and muttering, snow, snow, snow. jon waited until the last echoes had faded, then spurred his palfrey forward where everyone could see him. we're feeding you as best we can, as much as we can spare. apples, onions, neeps, carrots ... there's a long winter ahead for all of us, and our stores are not inexhaustible. you crows eat good enough. hal leek shoved forward. for now. we hold the wall. the wall protects the realm ... and you now. you know the foe we face. you know what's coming down on us. some of you have faced them before. wights and white walkers, dead things with blue eyes and black hands. i've seen them too, fought them, sent one to hell. they kill, then they send your dead against you. the giants were not able to stand against them, nor you thenns, the ice-river clans, the hornfoots, the free folk ... and as the days grow shorter and the nights colder, they are growing stronger. you left your homes and came south in your hundreds and your thousands ... why, but to escape them? to be safe. well, it's the wall that keeps you safe. it's us that keeps you safe, the black crows you despise. safe and starved, said a squat woman with a windburned face, a spearwife by the look of her. you want more food? asked jon. the food's for fighters. help us hold the wall, and you'll eat as well as any crow. or as poorly, when the food runs short. a silence fell. the wildlings exchanged wary looks. eat, the raven muttered. corn, corn. fight for you? this voice was thickly accented. sigorn, the young magnar of thenn, spoke the common tongue haltingly at best. not fight for you. kill you better. kill all you. the raven flapped its wings. kill, kill. sigorn's father, the old magnar, had been crushed beneath the falling stair during his attack on castle black. / would feel the same if someone asked me to make common cause with the lannisters, jon told himself. your father tried to kill us all, he reminded sigorn. the magnar was a brave man, yet he failed. and if he had succeeded ... who would hold the wall? he turned away from the thenns. winterfell's walls were strong as well, but winterfell stands in ruins today, burned and broken. a wall is only as good as the men defending it. an old man with a turnip cradled against his chest said, you kill us, you starve us, now you want t' make us slaves. a chunky red-faced man shouted assent. i'd sooner go naked than wear one o' them black rags on my back. one of the spearwives laughed. even your wife don't want to see you naked, butts. a dozen voices all began to speak at once. the thenns were shouting in the old tongue. a little boy began to cry. jon snow waited until all of it had died down, then turned to hairy hal and said, hal, what was it that you told this woman? hal looked confused. about the food, you mean? an apple or an onion? that's all i said. they got to pick. you have to pick, jon snow repeated. all of you. no one is asking you to take our vows, and i do not care what gods you worship. my own gods are the old gods, the gods of the north, but you can keep the red god, or the seven, or any other god who hears your prayers. it's spears we need. bows. eyes along the wall. i will take any boy above the age of twelve who knows how to hold a spear or string a bow. i will take your old men, your wounded, and your cripples, even those who can no longer fight. there are other tasks they may be able to perform. fletching arrows, milking goats, gathering fire-wood, mucking out our stables ... the work is endless. and yes, i will take your women too. i have no need of blushing maidens looking to be protected, but i will take as many spearwives as will come. and girls? a girl asked. she looked as young as arya had, the last time jon had seen her. sixteen and older. you're taking boys as young as twelve. down in the seven kingdoms boys of twelve were often pages or squires; many had been training at arms for years. girls of twelve were children. these are wildlings, though. as you will. boys and girls as young as twelve. but only those who know how to obey an order. that goes for all of you. i will never ask you to kneel to me, but i will set captains over you, and serjeants who will tell you when to rise and when to sleep, where to eat, when to drink, what to wear, when to draw your swords and loose your arrows. the men of the night's watch serve for life. i will not ask that of you, but so long as you are on the wall you will be under my command. disobey an order, and i'll have your head off. ask my brothers if i won't. they've seen me do it. off, screamed the old bear's raven. off, off, off. the choice is yours, jon snow told them. those who want to help us hold the wall, return to castle black with me and i'll see you armed and fed. the rest of you, get your turnips and your onions and crawl back inside your holes. the girl was the first to come forward. i can fight. my mother was a spearwife. jon nodded. she may not even be twelve, he thought, as she squirmed between a pair of old men, but he was not about to turn away his only recruit. a pair of striplings followed her, boys no older than fourteen. next a scarred man with a missing eye. i seen them too, the dead ones. even crows are better'n that. a tall spearwife, an old man on crutches, a moon-faced boy with a withered arm, a young man whose red hair reminded jon of ygritte. and then halleck. i don't like you, crow, he growled, but i never liked the mance neither, no more'n my sister did. still, we fought for him. why not fight for you? the dam broke then. halleck was a man of note. mance was not wrong. free folk don't follow names, or little cloth animals sewn on a tunic, the king-beyond-the-wall had told him. they won't dance for coins, they don't care how you style yourself or what that chain of office means or who your grandsire was. they follow strength. they follow the man. halleck's cousins followed halleck, then one of harma's banner-bearers, then men who'd fought with her, then others who had heard tales of their prowess. greybeards and green boys, fighting men in their prime, wounded men and cripples, a good score of spearwives, even three horn-foot men. but no thenns. the magnar turned and vanished back into the tunnels, and his bronze-clad minions followed hard at his heels. by the time the last withered apple had been handed out, the wagons were crowded with wildlings, and they were sixty-three stronger than when the column had set out from castle black that morning. what will you do with them? bowen marsh asked jon on the ride back up the kingsroad. train them, arm then, and split them up. send them where they're needed. eastwatch, the shadow tower, icemark, greyguard. i mean to open three more forts as well. the lord steward glanced back. women too? our brothers are not accustomed to having women amongst them, my lord. their vows ... there will be fights, rapes ... these women have knives and know how to use them. and the first time one of these spearwives slits the throat of one of our brothers, what then? we will have lost a man, said jon, but we have just gained sixty-three. you're good at counting, my lord. correct me if i'm wrong, but my reckoning leaves us sixty-two ahead. marsh was unconvinced. you've added sixty-three more mouths, my lord ... but how many are fighters, and whose side will they fight on? if it's the others at the gates, most like they'll stand with us, i grant you ... but if it's tormund giantsbane or the weeping man come calling with ten thousand howling killers, what then? then we'll know. so let us hope it never comes to that. when he heard the order, ser alliser's mouth twisted into a semblance of a smile, but his eyes remained as cold and hard as flint. so the bastard boy sends me out to die. die, cried mormont's raven. die, die, die. you are not helping. jon swatted the bird away. the bastard boy is sending you out to range. to find our foes and kill them if need be. you are skilled with a blade. you were master-at-arms, here and at eastwatch. thorne touched the hilt of his longsword. aye. i have squandered a third of my life trying to teach the rudiments of swordplay to churls, muttonheads, and knaves. small good that will do me in those woods. dywen will be with you, and another seasoned ranger. we'll learn you what you need t' know, ser, dywen told thorne, cackling. teach you how t' wipe your highborn arse with leaves, just like a proper ranger. kedge whit eye laughed at that, and blackjack bulwer spat. ser alliser only said, you would like me to refuse. then you could hack off my head, same as you did for slynt. i'll not give you that pleasure, bastard. you'd best pray that it's a wildling blade that kills me, though. the ones the others kill don't stay dead ... and they remember. i'm coming back, lord snow. i pray you do. jon would never count ser alliser thorne amongst his friends, but he was still a brother. no one ever said you had to like your brothers. it was no easy thing to send men into the wild, knowing that the chances were good that they might never return. they are all seasoned men, jon told himself ... but his uncle benjen and his rangers had been seasoned men as well, and the haunted forest had swallowed them up without a trace. when two of them finally came straggling back to the wall, it had been as wights. not for the first time, or the last, jon snow found himself wondering what had become of benjen stark. perhaps the rangers will come upon some sign of them, he told himself, never truly believing it. dywen would lead one ranging, black jack bulwer and kedge whit -eye the other two. they at least were eager for the duty. feels good to have a horse under me again, dywen said at the gate, sucking on his wooden teeth. begging your pardon, m'lord, but we were all o' us getting splinters up our arses from sitting about. no man in castle black knew the woods as well as dywen did, the trees and streams, the plants that could be eaten, the ways of predator and prey. thorne is in better hands than he deserves. jon watched the riders go from atop the wall— three parties, each of three men, each carrying a pair of ravens. from on high their garrons looked no larger than ants, and jon could not tell one ranger from another. he knew them, though. every name was graven on his heart. eight good men, he thought, and one ... well, we shall see. when the last of the riders had disappeared into the trees, jon snow rode the winch cage down with dolorous edd. a few scattered snowflakes were falling as they made their slow descent, dancing on the gusty wind. one followed the cage down, drifting just beyond the bars. it was falling faster than they were descending and from time to time would vanish beneath them. then a gust of wind would catch it and push it upward once again. jon could have reached through the bars and caught it if he had wished. i had a frightening dream last night, m'lord, dolorous edd confessed. you were my steward, fetching my food and cleaning up my leavings. i was lord commander, with never a moment's peace. jon did not smile. your nightmare, my life. cotter pyke's galleys were reporting ever-increasing numbers of free folk along the wooded shores to the north and east of the wall. camps had been seen, half-built rafts, even the hull of a broken cog that someone had begun repairing. the wildlings always vanished into the woods when seen, no doubt to reemerge as soon as pyke's ships had passed. meanwhile, ser denys mallister was still seeing fires in the night north of the gorge. both commanders were asking for more men. and where am i to get more men? jon had sent ten of the mole's town wildlings to each of them: green boys, old men, some wounded and infirm, but all capable of doing work of one sort or another. far from being pleased, pyke and mallister had both written back to complain. when i asked for men, i had in mind men of the night's watch, trained and disciplined, whose loyalty i should never have reason to doubt, wrote ser denys. cotter pyke was blunter. i could hang them from the wall as a warning to other wildlings to stay away, but i don't see any other use for them, maester harmune wrote for him. i wouldn't trust such to clean my chamber pot, and fen is not enough. the iron cage moved downward at the end of its long chain, creaking and rattling, until it finally jerked to a halt a foot above the ground at the base of the wall. dolorous edd pushed open the door and hopped down, his boots breaking the crust of the last snow. jon followed. outside the armory, iron emmett was still urging on his charges in the yard. the song of steel on steel woke a hunger in jon. it reminded him of warmer, simpler days, when he had been a boy at winterfell matching blades with robb under the watchful eye of ser rodrik cassel. ser rodrik too had fallen, slain bytheonturncloakand his ironmen as he'd tried to retake winterfell. the great stronghold of house stark was a scorched desolation. all my memories are poisoned. when iron emmett spied him, he raised a hand and combat ceased. lord commander. how may we serve you? with your three best. emmett grinned. arron. emrick. jace. horse and hop-robin fetched padding for the lord commander, along with a ringmail hauberk to go over it, and greaves, gorget, and halfhelm. a black shield rimmed with iron for his left arm, a blunted longsword for his right hand. the sword gleamed silvery grey in the dawn light, almost new. one of the last to come from donal's forge. a pity he did not live long enough to put an edge on it. the blade was shorter than longclaw but made of common steel, which made it heavier. his blows would be a little slower. it will serve. jon turned to face his foes. come. which one do you want first? asked arron. all three of you. at once. three on one? jace was incredulous. that wouldn't be fair. he was one of conwy's latest bunch, a cobbler's son from fair isle. maybe that explained it. true. come here. when he did, jon's blade slammed him alongside his head, knocking him off his feet. in the blink of an eye the boy had a boot on his chest and a swordpoint at his throat. war is never fair, jon told him. it's two on one now, and you're dead. when he heard gravel crunch, he knew the twins were coming. those two will make rangers yet. he spun, blocking arron's cut with the edge of his shield and meeting emrick's with his sword. those aren't spears, he shouted. get in close. he went to the attack to show them how it was done. emrick first. he slashed at his head and shoulders, right and left and right again. the boy got his shield up and tried a clumsy countercut. jon slammed his own shield into emrick' s, and brought him down with a blow to the lower leg ... none too soon, because arron was on him, with a crunching cut to the back of his thigh that sent him to one knee. that will leave a bruise. he caught the next cut on his shield, then lurched back to his feet and drove arron across the yard. he's quick, he thought, as the longswords kissed once and twice and thrice, but he needs to get stronger. when he saw relief in arron's eyes, he knew emrick was behind him. he came around and dealt him a cut to the back of the shoulders that sent him crashing into his brother. by that time jace had found his feet, so jon put him down again. i hate it when dead men get up. you'll feel the same the day you meet a wight. stepping back, he lowered his sword. the big crow can peck the little crows, growled a voice behind him, but has he belly enough to fight a man? rattleshirt was leaning against a wall. a coarse stubble covered his sunken cheeks, and thin brown hair was blowing across his little yellow eyes. you flatter yourself, jon said. aye, but i'd flatten you. stannis burned the wrong man. no. the wildling grinned at him through a mouth of brown and broken teeth. he burned the man he had to burn, for all the world to see. we all do what we have to do, snow. even kings. emmett, find some armor for him. i want him in steel, not old bones. once clad in mail and plate, the lord of bones seemed to stand a little straighter. he seemed taller too, his shoulders thicker and more powerful than jon would have thought. it's the armor, not the man, he told himself. even sam could appear almost formidable, clad head to heel in donal noye's steel. the wildling waved away the shield horse offered him. instead he asked for a two-handed sword. there's a sweet sound, he said, slashing at the air. flap closer, snow. i mean to make your feathers fly. jon rushed him hard. rattleshirt took a step backwards and met the charge with a two-handed slash. if jon had not interposed his shield, it might have staved his breast-plate in and broken half his ribs. the force of the blow staggered him for a moment and sent a solid jolt up his arm. he hits harder than i would have thought. his quickness was another unpleasant surprise. they circled round each other, trading blow for blow. the lord of bones gave as good as he was getting. by rights the two-handed greatsword should have been a deal more cumbersome than jon's longsword, but the wildling wielded it with blinding speed. iron emmett's fledglings cheered their lord commander at the start, but the relentless speed of rattleshirt's attack soon beat them down to silence. he cannot keep this up for long, jon told himself as he stopped another blow. the impact made him grunt. even dulled, the greatsword cracked his pinewood shield and bent the iron rim. he will tire soon. he must. jon slashed at the wildling's face, and rattleshirt pulled back his head. he hacked down at rattleshirt's calf, only to have him deftly leap the blade. the greatsword crashed down onto jon's shoulder, hard enough to ding his pouldron and numb the arm beneath. jon backed away. the lord of bones came after, chortling. he has no shield, jon reminded himself, and that monster sword's too cumbersome for parries. i should be landing two blows for every one of his. somehow he wasn't, though, and the blows he did land were having no effect. the wildling always seemed to be moving away or sliding sideways, so jon's longsword glanced off a shoulder or an arm. before long he found himself giving more ground, trying to avoid the other's crashing cuts and failing half the time. his shield had been reduced to kindling. he shook it off his arm. sweat was running down his face and stinging his eyes beneath his helm. he is too strong and too guick, he realized, and with that greatsword he has weight and reach on me. it would have been a different fight if jon had been armed with longclaw, but ... his chance came on rattleshirt's next backswing. jon threw himself forward, bulling into the other man, and they went down together, legs entangled. steel slammed on steel. both men lost their swords as they rolled on the hard ground. the wildling drove a knee between jon's legs. jon lashed out with a mailed fist. somehow rattleshirt ended up on top, with jon's head in his hands. he smashed it against the ground, then wrenched his visor open. if i had me a dagger, you'd be less an eye by now, he snarled, before horse and iron emmett dragged him off the lord commander's chest. let go o' me, you bloody crows, he roared. jon struggled to one knee. his head was ringing, and his mouth was full of blood. he spat it out and said, well fought. you flatter yourself, crow. i never broke a sweat. next time you will, said jon. dolorous edd helped him to his feet and unbuckled his helm. it had acquired several deep dents that had not been there when he'd donned it. release him. jon tossed the helm to hop-robin, who dropped it. my lord, said iron emmett, he threatened your life, we all heard. he said that if he had a dagger— he does have a dagger. right there on his belt. there is always someone guicker and stronger, ser rodrik had once told jon and robb. he's the man you want to face in the yard before you need to face his like upon a battlefield. lord snow? a soft voice said. he turned to find clydas standing beneath the broken archway, a parchment in his hand. from stannis? jon had been hoping for some word from the king. the night's watch took no part, he knew, and it should not matter to him which king emerged triumphant. somehow it did. is it deepwood? no, my lord. clydas thrust the parchment forward. it was tightly rolled and sealed, with a button of hard pink wax. only the dreadfort uses pink sealing wax. jon ripped off his gauntlet, took the letter, cracked the seal. when he saw the signature, he forgot the battering rattleshirt had given him. ramsay bolton, lord of the hornwood, it read, in a huge, spiky hand. the brown ink came away in flakes when jon brushed it with his thumb. beneath bolton's signature, lord dustin, lady cerwyn, and four ryswells had appended their own marks and seals. a cruder hand had drawn the giant of house umber. might we know what it says, my lord? asked iron emmett. jon saw no reason not to tell him. moat cailin is taken. the flayed corpses of the ironmen have been nailed to posts along the kingsroad. roose bolton summons all leal lords to barrowton, to affirm their loyalty to the iron throne and celebrate his son's wedding to ... his heart seemed to stop for a moment. no, that is not possible. she died in king's landing, with father. lord snow? clydas peered at him closely with his dim pink eyes. are you ... unwell? you seem ... he's to marry arya stark. my little sister. jon could almost see her in that moment, long-faced and gawky, all knobby knees and sharp elbows, with her dirty face and tangled hair. they would wash the one and comb the other, he did not doubt, but he could not imagine arya in a wedding gown, nor ramsay bolton's bed. no matter how afraid she is, she will not show it. if he tries to lay a hand on her, she'll fight him. your sister, iron emmett said, how old is ... by now she'd be eleven, jon thought. still a child. i have no sister. only brothers. only you. lady catelyn would have rejoiced to hear those words, he knew. that did not make them easier to say. his fingers closed around the parchment. would that they could crush ramsay bolton's throat as easily. clydas cleared his throat. will there be an answer? jon shook his head and walked away. by nightfall the bruises that rattleshirt had given him had turned purple. they'll go yellow before they fade away, he told mormont's raven. i'll look as sallow as the lord of bones. bones, the bird agreed. bones, bones. he could hear the faint murmur of voices coming from outside, although the sound was too weak to make out words. they sound a thousand leagues away. it was lady melisandreand her followers at their nightfire. every night at dusk the red woman led her followers in their twilight prayer, asking her red god to see them through the dark. for the night is dark and full of terrors. with stannis and most of the queen's men gone, her flock was much diminished; half a hundred of the free folk up from mole's town, the handful of guards the king had left her, perhaps a dozen black brothers who had taken her red god for their own. jon felt as stiff as a man of sixty years. dark dreams, he thought, and guilt. his thoughts kept returning to arya. there is no way i can help her. i put all kin aside when i said my words. if one of my men told me his sister was in peril, i would tell him that was no concern of his. once a man had said the words his blood was black. black as a bastard's heart. he'd had mikken make a sword for arya once, a bravo's blade, made small to fit her hand. needle. he wondered if she still had it. stick them with the pointy end, he'd told her, but if she tried to stick the bastard, it could mean her life. snow, muttered lord mormont's raven. snow, snow. suddenly he could not suffer it a moment longer. he found ghost outside his door, gnawing on the bone of an ox to get at the marrow. when did you get back? the direwolf got to his feet, abandoning the bone to come padding after jon. mully and kegs stood inside the doors, leaning on their spears. a cruel cold out there, m'lord, warned mully through his tangled orange beard. will you be out long? no. i just need a breath of air. jon stepped out into the night. the sky was full of stars, and the wind was gusting along the wall. even the moon looked cold; there were goosebumps all across its face. then the first gust caught him, slicing through his layers of wool and leather to set his teeth to chattering. he stalked across the yard, into the teeth of that wind. his cloak flapped loudly from his shoulders. ghost came after. where am i going? what am i doing? castle black was still and silent, its halls and towers dark. my seat, jon snow reflected. my hall, my home, my command. a ruin. in the shadow of the wall, the direwolf brushed up against his fingers. for half a heartbeat the night came alive with a thousand smells, and jon snow heard the crackle of the crust breaking on a patch of old snow. someone was behind him, he realized suddenly. someone who smelled warm as a summer day. when he turned he saw ygritte. she stood beneath the scorched stones of the lord commander's tower, cloaked in darkness and in memory. the light of the moon was in her hair, her red hair kissed by fire. when he saw that, jon's heart leapt into his mouth. ygritte, he said. lord snow. the voice was melisandre's. surprise made him recoil from her. lady melisandre. he took a step backwards. i mistook you for someone else. at night all robes are grey. yet suddenly hers were red. he did not understand how he could have taken her for ygritte. she was taller, thinner, older, though the moonlight washed years from her face. mist rose from her nostrils, and from pale hands naked to the night. you will freeze your fingers off, jon warned. if that is the will of r'hllor. night's powers cannot touch one whose heart is bathed in god's holy fire. you heart does not concern me. just your hands. the heart is all that matters. do not despair, lord snow. despair is a weapon of the enemy, whose name may not be spoken. your sister is not lost to you. i have no sister. the words were knives. what do you know of my heart, priestess? what do you know of my sister? melisandre seemed amused. what is her name, this little sister that you do not have? arya. his voice was hoarse. my half-sister, truly ... ... for you are bastard born. i had not forgotten. i have seen your sister in my fires, fleeing from this marriage they have made for her. coming here, to you. a girl in grey on a dying horse, i have seen it plain as day. it has not happened yet, but it will. she gazed at ghost. may i touch your ... wolf? the thought made jon uneasy. best not. he will not harm me. you call him ghost, yes? yes, but ... ghost. melisandre made the word a song. the direwolf padded toward her. wary, he stalked about her in a circle, sniffing. when she held out her hand he smelled that too, then shoved his nose against her fingers. jon let out a white breath. he is not always so ... ... warm? warmth calls to warmth, jon snow. her eyes were two red stars, shining in the dark. at her throat, her ruby gleamed, a third eye glowing brighter than the others. jon had seen ghost's eyes blazing red the same way, when they caught the light just right. ghost, he called. to me. the direwolf looked at him as if he were a stranger. jon frowned in disbelief. that's ... queer. you think so? she knelt and scratched ghost behind his ear. your wall is a queer place, but there is power here, if you will use it. power in you, and in this beast. you resist it, and that is your mistake. embrace it. use it. / am not a wolf, he thought. and how would i do that? i can show you. melisandre draped one slender arm over ghost, and the direwolf licked her face. the lord of light in his wisdom made us male and female, two parts of a greater whole. in our joining there is power. power to make life. power to make light. power to cast shadows. shadows. the world seemed darker when he said it. every man who walks the earth casts a shadow on the world. some are thin and weak, others long and dark. you should look behind you, lord snow. the moon has kissed you and etched your shadow upon the ice twenty feet tall. jon glanced over his shoulder. the shadow was there, just as she had said, etched in moonlight against the wall. a girl in grey on a dying horse, he thought. coming here, to you. arya. he turned back to the red priest-ess. jon could feel her warmth. she has power. the thought came unbidden, seizing him with iron teeth, but this was not a woman he cared to be indebted to, not even for his little sister. dalla told me something once. val's sister, mance rayder's wife. she said that sorcery was a sword without a hilt. there is no safe way to grasp it. a wise woman. melisandre rose, her red robes stirring in the wind. a sword without a hilt is still a sword, though, and a sword is a fine thing to have when foes are all about. hear me now, jon snow. nine crows flew into the white wood to find your foes for you. three of them are dead. they have not died yet, but their death is out there waiting for them, and they ride to meet it. you sent them forth to be your eyes in the darkness, but they will be eyeless when they return to you. i have seen their pale dead faces in my flames. empty sockets, weeping blood. she pushed her red hair back, and her red eyes shone. you do not believe me. you will. the cost of that belief will be three lives. a small price to pay for wisdom, some might say ... but not one you had to pay. remember that when you behold the blind and ravaged faces of your dead. and come that day, take my hand. the mist rose from her pale flesh, and for a moment it seemed as if pale, sorcerous flames were playing about her fingers. take my hand, she said again, and let me save your sister. the sun had broken through near midday, after seven days of dark skies and snow flurries. some of the drifts were higher than a man, but the stewards had been shoveling all day and the paths were as clean as they were like to get. reflections glimmered off the wall, every crack and crevice glittering pale blue. seven hundred feet up, jon snow stood looking down upon the haunted forest. a north wind swirled through the trees below, sending thin white plumes of snow crystals flying from the highest branches, like icy banners. elsewise nothing moved. not a sign of life. that was not entirely reassuring. it was not the living that he feared. even so ... the sun is out. the snow has stopped. it may be a moon's turn before we have another chance as good. it may be a season. have emmett assemble his recruits, he told dolorous edd. we'll want an escort. ten rangers, armed with dragonglass. i want them ready to leave within the hour. aye, m'lord. and to command? that would be me. edd's mouth turned down even more than usual. some might think it better if the lord commander stayed safe and warm south of the wall. not that i'd say such myself, but some might. jon smiled. some had best not say so in my presence. a sudden gust of wind set edd's cloak to flapping noisily. best go down, m'lord. this wind's like to push us off the wall, and i never did learn the knack of flying. they rode the winch lift back to the ground. the wind was gusting, cold as the breath of the ice dragon in the tales old nan had told when jon was a boy. the heavy cage was swaying. from time to time it scraped against the wall, starting small crystalline showers of ice that sparkled in the sunlight as they fell, like shards of broken glass. glass, jon mused, might be of use here. castle black needs its own glass gardens, like the ones at winterfell. we could grow vegetables even in the deep of winter. the best glass came from myr, but a good clear pane was worth its weight in spice, and green and yellow glass would not work as well. what we need is gold. with enough coin, we could buy 'prentice glass-blowers and glaziers in myr, bring them north, offer them their freedom for teaching their art to some of our recruits. that would be the way to go about it. if we had the gold. which we do not. at the base of the wall he found ghost rolling in a snowbank. the big white direwolf seemed to love fresh snow. when he saw jon he bounded back onto his feet and shook himself off. dolorous edd said, he's going with you? he is. a clever wolf, him. and me? you're not. a clever lord, you. ghost's the better choice. i don't have the teeth for biting wildlings anymore. if the gods are good, we won't encounter any wildlings. i'll want the grey gelding. word spread fast at castle black. edd was still saddling the grey when bowen marsh stomped across the yard to confront jon at the stables. my lord, i wish you would reconsider. the new men can take their vows in the sept as easily. the sept is home to the new gods. the old gods live in the wood, and those who honor them say their words amongst the weirwoods. you know that as well as i. satin comes from oldtown, and arron and emrick from the wester-lands. the old gods are not their gods. i do not tell men which god to worship. they were free to choose the seven or the red woman's lord of light. they chose the trees instead, with all the peril that entails. the weeping man may still be out there, watching. the grove is no more than two hours' ride, even with the snow. we should be back by midnight. too long. this is not wise. unwise, said jon, but necessary. these men are about to pledge their lives to the night's watch, joining a brotherhood that stretches back in an unbroken line for thousands of years. the words matter, and so do these traditions. they bind us all together, highborn and low, young and old, base and noble. they make us brothers. he clapped marsh on his shoulder. i promise you, we shall return. aye, my lord, said the lord steward, but will it be as living men or heads on spears with your eyes scooped out? you will be returning through the black of night. the snowdrifts are waist deep in places. i see that you are taking seasoned men with you, that is good, but black jack bulwer knew these woods as well. even benjen stark, your own uncle, he— i have something they did not. jon turned his head and whistled. ghost. to me. the direwolf shook the snow from his back and trotted to jon's side. the rangers parted to let him through, though one mare whinnied and shied away till rory gave her reins a sharp tug. the wall is yours, lord bowen. he took his horse by the bridle and walked him to the gate and the icy tunnel that snaked beneath the wall. beyond the ice, the trees stood tall and silent, huddled in the thick white cloaks. ghost stalked beside jon's horse as the rangers and recruits formed up, then stopped and sniffed, his breath frosting in the air. what is it? jon asked. is someone there? the woods were empty as far as he could see, but that was not very far. ghost bounded toward the trees, slipped between two white-cloaked pines, and vanished in a cloud of snow. he wants to hunt, but what? jon did not fear for the direwolf so much as for any wildlings he might encounter. a white wolf in a white wood, silent as a shadow. they will never know he's coming. he knew better than to go chasing him. ghost would return when he wanted to and not before. jon put his heels into his horse. his men fell in around them, the hooves of their garrons breaking through the icy crust to the softer snow beneath. into the woods they went, at a steady walking pace, as the wall dwindled behind them. the soldier pines and sentinels wore thick white coats, and icicles draped the bare brown limbs of the broadleafs. jon sent tom barleycorn ahead to scout for them, though the way to the white grove was oft trod and familiar. big liddle and luke of longtown slipped into the brush to east and west. they would flank the column to give warning of any approach. all were seasoned rangers, armed with obsidian as well as steel, warhorns slung across their saddles should they need to summon help. the others were good men too. good men in a fight, at least, and loyal to their brothers. jon could not speak for what they might have been before they reached the wall, but he did not doubt that most had pasts as black as their cloaks. up here, they were the sort of men he wanted at his back. their hoods were raised against the biting wind, and some had scarves wrapped about their faces, hiding their features. jon knew them, though. every name was graven on his heart. they were his men, his brothers. six more rode with them— a mix of young and old, large and small, seasoned and raw. six to say the words. horse had been born and raised in mole's town, arron and emrick came from fair isle, satin from the brothels of oldtown at the other end of westerns. all of them were boys. leathers and jax were older men, well past forty, sons of the haunted forest, with sons and grandsons of their own. they had been two of the sixty-three wildlings who had followed jon snow back to the wall the day he made his appeal, so far the only two to decide they wanted a black cloak. iron emmett said they all were ready, or as ready as they were ever going to be. he and jon and bowen marsh had weighed each man in turn and assigned him to an order: leathers, jax, and emrick to the rangers, horse to the builders, arron and satin to the stewards. the time had come for them to take their vows. iron emmett rode at the head of the column, mounted on the ugliest horse jon had ever seen, a shaggy beast that looked to be all hair and hooves. talk is there was some trouble at harlot's tower last night, the master-at-arms said. hardin's tower. of the sixty-three who had come back with him from mole's town, nineteen had been women and girls. jon had housed them in the same abandoned tower where he had once slept when he had been new to the wall. twelve were spearwives, more than capable of defending both themselves and the younger girls from the unwanted attentions of black brothers. it was some of the men they'd turned away who'd given hardin's tower its new, inflammatory name. jon was not about to condone the mockery. three drunken fools mistook hardin's for a brothel, that's all. they are in the ice cells now, contemplating their mistake. iron emmett grimaced. men are men, vows are words, and words are wind. you should put guards around the women. and who will guard the guards? you know nothing, jon snow. he had learned, though, and ygritte had been his teacher. if he could not hold to his own vows, how could he expect more of his brothers? but there were dangers in trifling with wildling women. a man can own a woman, and a man can own a knife, ygritte had told him once, but no man can own both. bowen marsh had not been all wrong. hardin's tower was tinder waiting for a spark. i mean to open three more castles, jon said. deep lake, sable hall, and the long barrow. all garrisoned with free folk, under the command of our own officers. the long barrow will be all women, aside from the commander and chief steward. there would be some mingling, he did not doubt, but the distances were great enough to make that difficult, at least. and what poor fool will get that choice command? i am riding beside him. the look of mingled horror and delight that passed across iron emmett's face was worth more than a sack of gold. what have i done to make you hate me so, my lord? jon laughed. have no fear, you won't be alone. i mean to give you dolorous edd as your second and your steward. the spearwives will be so happy. you might do well to bestow a castle on the magnar. jon's smile died. i might if i could trust him. sigorn blames me for his father's death, i fear. worse, he was bred and trained to give orders, not to take them. do not confuse the thenns with free folk. magnar means lord in the old tongue, i am told, but styr was closer to a god to his people, and his son is cut from the same skin. i do not require men to kneel, but they do need to obey. aye, m'lord, but you had best do something with the magnar. you'll have trouble with the thenns if you ignore them. trouble is the lord commander's lot, jon might have said. his visit to mole's town was giving him plenty, as it happened, and the women were the least of it. halleck was proving to be just as truculent as he had feared, and there were some amongst the black brothers whose hatred of the free folk was bone deep. one of halleck's followers had already cut off a build-er's ear in the yard, and like as not that was just a taste of the bloodshed to come. he had to get the old forts open soon, so harma's brother could be sent off to garrison deep lake or sable hall. just now, though, neither of those was fit for human habitation, and othell yarwyck and his builders were still off trying to restore the nightfort. there were nights when jon snow wondered if he had not made a grievous mistake by preventing stannis from marching all the wild lings off to be slaughtered. / know nothing, ygritte, he thought, and perhaps i never will. half a mile from the grove, long red shafts of autumn sunlight were slanting down between the branches of the leafless trees, staining the snowdrifts pink. the riders crossed a frozen stream, between two jagged rocks armored in ice, then followed a twisting game trail to the northeast. whenever the wind kicked up, sprays of loose snow filled the air and stung their eyes. jon pulled his scarf up over his mouth and nose and raised the hood on his cloak. not far now, he told the men. no one replied. jon smelled tom barleycorn before he saw him. or was it ghost who smelled him? of late, jon snow sometimes felt as if he and the direwolf were one, even awake. the great white wolf appeared first, shaking off the snow. a few moments later tom was there. wildlings, he told jon, softly. in the grove. jon brought the riders to a halt. how many? i counted nine. no guards. some dead, might be, or sleeping. most look to be women. one child, but there's a giant too. just the one that i saw. they got a fire burning, smoke drifting through the trees. fools. nine, and i have seven-and-ten. four of his were green boys, though, and none were giants. jon was not of a mind to fall back to the wall, however. if the wildlings are still alive, it may be we can bring them in. and if they are dead, well ... a corpse or two could be of use. we'll continue on foot, he said, dropping lightly to the frozen ground. the snow was ankle deep. rory, pate, stay with the horses. he might have given that duty to the recruits, but they would need to be blooded soon enough. this was as good a time as any. spread out and form a crescent. i want to close in on the grove from three sides. keep the men to your right and left in sight, so the gaps do not widen. the snow should muffle our steps. less chance of blood if we take them unawares. night was falling fast. the shafts of sunlight had vanished when the last thin slice of the sun was swallowed beneath the western woods. the pink snow drifts were going white again, the color leaching out of them as the world darkened. the evening sky had turned the faded grey of an old cloak that had been washed too many times, and the first shy stars were coming out. ahead he glimpsed a pale white trunk that could only be a weirwood, crowned with a head of dark red leaves. jon snow reached back and pulled longclaw from his sheath. he looked to right and left, gave satin and horse a nod, watched them pass it on to the men beyond. they rushed the grove together, kicking through drifts of old snow with no sound but their breathing. ghost ran with them, a white shadow at jon's side. the weirwoods rose in a circle around the edges of the clearing. there were nine, all roughly of the same age and size. each one had a face carved into it, and no two faces were alike. some were smiling, some were screaming, some were shouting at him. in the deepening glow their eyes looked black, but in daylight they would be blood-red, jon knew. eyes like ghost's. the fire in the center of the grove was a small sad thing, ashes and embers and a few broken branches burning slow and smoky. even then, it had more life than the wildlings huddled near it. only one of them reacted when jon stepped from the brush. that was the child, who began to wail, clutching at his mother's ragged cloak. the woman raised her eyes and gasped. by then the grove was ringed by rangers, sliding past the bone-white trees, steel glinting in black-gloved hands, poised for slaughter. the giant was the last to notice them. he had been asleep, curled up by the fire, but something woke him— the child's cry, the sound of snow crunching beneath black boots, a sudden indrawn breath. when he stirred it was as if a boulder had come to life. he heaved himself into a sitting position with a snort, pawing at his eyes with hands as big as hams to rub the sleep away ... until he saw iron emmett, his sword shining in his hand. roaring, he came leaping to his feet, and one of those huge hands closed around a maul and jerked it up. ghost showed his teeth in answer. jon grabbed the wolf by the scruff of the neck. we want no battle here. his men could bring the giant down, he knew, but not without cost. once blood was shed, the wildlings would join the fray. most or all would die here, and some of his own brothers too. this is a holy place. yield, and we— the giant bellowed again, a sound that shook the leaves in the trees, and slammed his maul against the ground. the shaft of it was six feet of gnarled oak, the head a stone as big as a loaf of bread. the impact made the ground shake. some of the other wildlings went scrambling for their own weapons. jon snow was about to reach for longclaw when leathers spoke, from the far side of the grove. his words sounded gruff and guttural, but jon heard the music in it and recognized the old tongue. leathers spoke for a long while. when he was done, the giant answered. it sounded like growling, interspersed with grunts, and jon could not understand a word of it. but leathers pointed at the trees and said something else, and the giant pointed at the trees, ground his teeth, and dropped his maul. it's done, said leathers. they want no fight. well done. what did you tell him? that they were our gods too. that we came to pray. we shall. put away your steel, all of you. we will have no blood shed here tonight. nine, tom barleycorn had said, and nine there were, but two were dead and one so weak he might have died by morning. the six who remained included a mother and child, two old men, a wounded thenn in battered bronze, and one of the hornfoot folk, his bare feet so badly frostbitten that jon knew at a glance he would never walk again. most had been strangers to one another when they came to the grove, he learned subsequently; when stannis broke mance rayder's host, they had fled into the woods to escape the carnage, wandered for a time, lost friends and kin to cold and starvation, and finally washed up here, too weak and weary to go on. the gods are here, one of the old men said. this was as good a place to die as any. the wall is only a few hours south of here, said jon. why not seek shelter there? others yielded. even mance. the wildlings exchanged looks. finally one said, we heard stories. the crows burned all them that yielded. even mance hisself, the woman added. melisandre, jon thought, you and your red god have much and more to answer for. all those who wish are welcome to return with us. there is food and shelter at castle black, and the wall to keep you safe from the things that haunt these woods. you have my word, no one will burn. a crow's word, the woman said, hugging her child close, but who's to say that you can keep it? who are you? lord commander of the night's watch, and a son of eddard stark of winterfell. jon turned to tom barleycorn. have rory and pate bring up the horses. i do not mean to stay here one moment longer than we must. as you say, m'lord. one last thing remained before they could depart: the thing that they had come for. iron emmett called forth his charges, and as the rest of the company watched from a respectful distance, they knelt before the weir-woods. the last light of day was gone by then; the only light came from the stars above and the faint red glow of the dying fire in the center of the grove. with their black hoods and thick black cowls, the six might have been carved from shadow. their voices rose together, small against the vastness of the night. night gathers, and now my watch begins, they said, as thousands had said before them. satin's voice was sweet as song, horse's hoarse and halting, arron's a nervous squeak. it shall not end until my death. may those deaths be long in coming. jon snow sank to one knee in the snow. gods of my fathers, protect these men. and arya too, my little sister, wherever she might be. i pray you, let mance find her and bring her safe to me. i shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children, the recruits promised, in voices that echoed back through years and centuries. i shall wear no crowns and win no glory. i shall live and die at my post. gods of the wood, grant me the strength to do the same, jon snow prayed silently. give me the wisdom to know what must be done and the courage to do it. i am the sword in the darkness, said the six, and it seemed to jon as though their voices were changing, growing stronger, more certain. i am the watcher on the walls. i am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. the shield that guards the realms of men. ghost nuzzled up against his shoulder, and jon draped an arm around him. he could smell horse's unwashed breeches, the sweet scent satin combed into his beard, the rank sharp smell of fear, the giant's overpowering musk. he could hear the beating of his own heart. when he looked across the grove at the woman with her child, the two greybeards, the hornfoot man with his maimed feet, all he saw was men. i pledge my life and honor to the night's watch, for this night and all the nights to come. jon snow was the first onto his feet. rise now as men of the night's watch. he gave horse a hand to pull him up. the wind was rising. it was time to go. the journey back took much longer than the journey to the grove. the giant's pace was a ponderous one, despite the length and girth of those legs, and he was forever stopping to knock snow off low-hanging limbs with his maul. the woman rode double with rory, her son with tom barleycorn, the old men with horse and satin. thethenn was frightened of the horses, however, and preferred to limp along despite his wounds. the hornfoot man could not sit a saddle and had to be tied over the back of a garron like a sack of grain; so too the pale-faced crone with the stick-thin limbs, whom they had not been able to rouse. they did the same with the two corpses, to the puzzlement of iron emmett. they will only slow us, my lord, he said to jon. we should chop them up and burn them. no, said jon. bring them. i have a use for them. they had no moon to guide them home, and only now and then a patch of stars. the world was black and white and still. it was a long, slow, endless trek. the snow clung to their boots and breeches, and the wind rattled the pines and made their cloaks snap and swirl. jon glimpsed the red wanderer above, watching them through the leafless branches of great trees as they made their way beneath. the thief, the free folk called it. the best time to steal a woman was when the thief was in the moonmaid, ygritte had always claimed. she never mentioned the best time to steal a giant. or two dead men. it was almost dawn before they saw the wall again. a sentry's horn greeted them as they approached, sounding from on high like the cry of some huge, deep-throated bird, a single long blast that meant rangers returning. big liddle unslung his own warhorn and gave answer. at the gate, they had to wait a few moments before dolorous edd tollett appeared to slide back the bolts and swing open the iron bars. when edd caught sight of the ragged band of wildlings, he pursed his lips and gave the giant a long look. might need some butter to slide that one through the tunnel, m'lord. shall i send someone to the larder? oh, i think he'll fit. unbuttered. so he did ... on hands and knees, crawling. a big boy, this one. fourteen feet, at least. even bigger than mag the mighty. mag had died beneath this very ice, locked in mortal struggle with donal noye. a good man. the watch has lost too many good men. jon took leathers aside. take charge of him. you speak his tongue. see that he is fed and find him a warm place by the fire. stay with him. see that no one provokes him. aye. leathers hesitated. m'lord. the living wildlings jon sent off to have their wounds and frostbites tended. some hot food and warm clothes would restore most of them, he hoped, though the hornfoot man was like to lose both feet. the corpses he consigned to the ice cells. clydas had come and gone, jon noted as he was hanging his cloak on the peg beside the door. a letter had been left on the table in his solar. eastwatch or the shadow tower, he assumed at first glance. but the wax was gold, not black. the seal showed a stag's head within a flaming heart. stannis. jon cracked the hardened wax, flattened the roll of parchment, read. a maester's hand, but the king's words. stannis had taken deepwood motte, and the mountain clans had joined him. flint, norrey, wull, liddle, all. and we had other help, unexpected but most welcome, from a daughter of bear island. alysane mormont, whose men name her the she-bear, hid fighters inside a gaggle of fishing sloops and took the ironmen unawares where they lay off the strand. greyjoy's longships are burned or taken, her crews slain or surrendered. the captains, knights, notable warriors, and others of high birth we shall ransom or make other use of, the rest i mean to hang ... the night's watch was sworn to take no side in the quarrels and conflicts of the realm. nonetheless, jon snow could not help but feel a certain satisfaction. he read on. ... more northmen coming in as word spreads of our victory. fisherfolk, freeriders, hillmen, crofters from the deep of the wolfswood and villagers wh o fled their homes along the stony shore to escape the ironmen, survivors from the battle outside the gates of winterfell, men once sworn to the hornwoods, the cerwyns, and the tallharts. we are five thousand strong as i write, our numbers swelling every day. and word has come to us that roose bolton moves toward winterfell with all his power, there to wed his bastard to your half sister. he must not be allowed to restore the castle to its former strength. we march against him. arnolf karstark and mors umber will join us. i will save your sister if i can, and find a better match for her than ramsay snow. you and your brothers must hold the wall until i can return. it was signed, in a different hand, done in the light of lord, under the sign and seal of stannis of house baratheon, the first of his name, king of the andals, the rhoynar, and the first men, lord of the seven kingdoms, and protector of the realm. the moment jon set the letter aside, the parchment curled up again, as if eager to protect its secrets. he was not at all sure how he felt about what he had just read. battles had been fought at winterfell before, but never one without a stark on one side or the other. the castle is a shell, he said, not winterfell, but the ghost of winterfell. it was painful just to think of it, much less say the words aloud. and still ... he wondered how many men old crowfood would bring to the fray, and how many swords arnolf karstark would be able to conjure up. half the umbers would be across the field with whoresbane, fighting beneath the flayed man of the dreadfort, and the greater part of the strength of both houses had gone south with robb, never to return. even ruined, winterfell itself would confer a considerable advantage on whoever held it. robert baratheon would have seen that at once and moved swiftly to secure the castle, with the forced marches and midnight rides for which he had been famous. would his brother be as bold? not likely. stannis was a deliberate commander, and his host was a half-digested stew of clansmen, southron knights, king's men and queen's men, salted with a few northern lords. he should move on winterfell swiftly, or not at all, jon thought. it was not his place to advise the king, but ... he glanced at the letter again. / will save your sister if i can. a surprisingly tender sentiment from stannis, though undercut by that final, brutal if i can and the addendum and find a better match for her than ramsay snow. but what if arya was not thereto be saved? what if lady melisandre's flames had told it true? could his sister truly have escaped such captors? how would she do that? arya was always quick and clever, but in the end she's just a little girl, and roose bolton is not the sort who would be careless with a prize of such great worth. what if bolton never had his sister? this wedding could well be just some ruse to lure stannis into a trap. eddard stark had never had any reason to complain of the lord of the dreadfort, so far as jon knew, but even so he had never trusted him, with his whispery voice and his pale, pale eyes. a grey girl on a dying horse, fleeing from her marriage. on the strength of those words he had loosed mance rayder and six spearwives on the north. young ones, and pretty, mance had said. the unburnt king supplied some names, and dolorous edd had done the rest, smuggling them from mole's town. it seemed like madness now. he might have done better to strike down mance the moment he revealed himself. jon had a certain grudging admiration for the late king-beyond-the-wall, but the man was an oathbreaker and a turncloak. he had even less trust in melisandre. yet somehow here he was, pinning his hopes on them. all to save my sister. but the men of the night's watch have no sisters. when jon had been a boy at winterfell, his hero had been the young dragon, the boy king who had conquered dome at the age of fourteen. despite his bastard birth, or perhaps because of it, jon snow had dreamed of leading men to glory just as king daeron had, of growing up to be a conqueror. now he was a man grown and the wall was his, yet all he had were doubts. he could not even seem to conquer those. val waited by the gate in the predawn cold, wrapped up in a bearskin cloak so large it might well have fit sam. beside her was a garron, saddled and bridled, a shaggy grey with one white eye. mully and dolorous edd stood with her, a pair of unlikely guards. their breath frosted in the cold black air. you gave her a blind horse? jon said, incredulous. he's only half-blind, m'lord, offered mully. elsewise he's sound enough. he patted the garron on the neck. the horse may be half-blind, but i am not, said val. i know where i must go. my lady, you do not have to do this. the risk— —is mine, lord snow. and i am no southron lady but a woman of the free folk. i know the forest better than all your black-cloaked rangers. it holds no ghosts for me. / hope not. jon was counting on that, trusting that val could succeed where black jack bulwer and his companions had failed. she need fear no harm from the free folk, he hoped ... but both of them knew too well that wildlings were not the only ones waiting in the woods. you have sufficient food? hard bread, hard cheese, oat cakes, salt cod, salt beef, salt mutton, and a skin of sweet wine to rinse all that salt out of my mouth. i will not die of hunger. then it's time you were away. you have my word, lord snow. i will return, with tormund or without him. val glanced at the sky. the moon was but half-full. look for me on the first day of the full moon. i will. do not fail me, he thought, orstannis will have my head. do i have your word that you will keep our princess closely? the king had said, and jon had promised that he would. val is no princess, though. i told him that half a hundred times. it was a feeble sort of evasion, a sad rag wrapped around his wounded word. his father would never have approved. / am the sword that guards the realm of men, jon reminded himself, and in the end, that must be worth more than one man's honor. the road beneath the wall was as dark and cold as the belly of an ice dragon and as twisty as a serpent. dolorous edd led them through with a torch in hand. mully had the keys for the three gates, where bars of black iron as thick as a man's arm closed off the passage. spearmen at each gate knuckled their foreheads at jon snow but stared openly at val and her garron. when they emerged north of the wall, through a thick door made of freshly hewn green wood, the wildling princess paused for a moment to gaze out across the snow -covered field where king stannis had won his battle. beyond, the haunted forest waited, dark and silent. the light of the half-moon turned val's honey-blond hair a pale silver and left her cheeks as white as snow. she took a deep breath. the air tastes sweet. my tongue is too numb to tell. all i can taste is cold. cold? val laughed lightly. no. when it is cold it will hurt to breathe. when the others come ... the thought was a disquieting one. six of the rangers jon had sent out were still missing. it is too soon. they may yet be back. but another part of him insisted, they are dead, every man of them. you sent them out to die, and you are doing the same to val. tell tormund what i've said. he may not heed your words, but he will hear them. val kissed him lightly on the cheek. you have my thanks, lord snow. for the half-blind horse, the salt cod, the free air. for hope. their breath mingled, a white mist in the air. jon snow drew back and said, the only thanks i want is— —tormund giantsbane. aye. val pulled up the hood of her bearskin. the brown pelt was well salted with grey. before i go, one question. did you kill jarl, my lord? the wall killed jarl. so i'd heard. but i had to be sure. you have my word. i did not kill him. though i might have if things had gone otherwise. this is farewell, then, she said, almost playfully. jon snow was in no mood for it. it is too cold and dark to play, and the hour is too late. only for a time. you will return. for the boy, if for no other reason. craster's son? val shrugged. he is no kin to me. i have heard you singing to him. i was singing to myself. am i to blame if he listens? a faint smile brushed her lips. it makes him laugh. oh, very well. he is a sweet little monster. monster? his milk name. i had to call him something. see that he stays safe and warm. for his mother's sake, and mine. and keep him away from the red woman. she knows who he is. she sees things in her fires. arya, he thought, hoping it was so. ashes and cinders. kings and dragons. dragons again. for a moment jon could almost see them too, coiling in the night, their dark wings outlined against a sea of flame. if she knew, she would have taken the boy away from us. dalla's boy, not your monster. a word in the king's ear would have been the end of it. and of me. stannis would have taken it for treason. why let it happen if she knew? because it suited her. fire is a fickle thing. no one knows which way a flame will go. val put a foot into a stirrup, swung her leg over her horse's back, and looked down from the saddle. do you remember what my sister told you? yes. a sword without a hilt, with no safe way to hold it. but melisandre had the right of it. even a sword without a hilt is better than an empty hand when foes are all around you. good. val wheeled thegarron toward the north. the first night of the full moon, then. jon watched her ride away wondering if he would ever see her face again. / am no southron lady, he could hear her say, but a woman of the free folk. i don't care what she says, muttered dolorous edd, as val vanished behind a stand of soldier pines. the air is so cold it hurts to breathe. i would stop, but that would hurt worse. he rubbed his hands together. this is going to end badly. you say that of everything. aye, m'lord. usually i'm right. mully cleared his throat. m'lord? the wildling princess, letting her go, the men may say— —that i am half a wildling myself, a turncloak who means to sell the realm to our raiders, cannibals, and giants. jon did not need to stare into a fire to know what was being said of him. the worst part was, they were not wrong, not wholly. words are wind, and the wind is always blowing at the wall. come. it was still dark when jon returned to his chambers behind the armory. ghost was not yet back, he saw. still hunting. the big white direwolf was gone more oft than not of late, ranging farther and farther in search of prey. between the men of the watch and the wildlings down in mole's town, the hills and fields near castle black had been hunted clean, and there had been little enough game to begin with. winter is coming, jon reflected. and soon, too soon. he wondered if they would ever see a spring. dolorous edd made the trek to the kitchens and soon was back with a tankard of brown ale and a covered platter. under the lid jon discovered three duck's eggs fried in drippings, a strip of bacon, two sausages, a blood pudding, and half a loaf of bread still warm from the oven. he ate the bread and half an egg. he would have eaten the bacon too, but the raven made off with it before he had the chance. thief, jon said, as the bird flapped up to the lintel above the door to devour its prize. thief, the raven agreed. jon tried a bite of sausage. he was washing the taste from his mouth with a sip of ale when edd returned to tell him bowen marsh was without. othell's with him, and septon cellador. that was guick. he wondered who was telling tales and if there was more than one. send them in. aye, m'lord. you'll want to watch your sausages with this lot, though. they have a hungry look about them. hungry was not the word jon would have used. septon cellador appeared confused and groggy and in dire need of some scales from the dragon that had flamed him, whilst first builder othell yarwyck looked as if he had swallowed something he could not quite digest. bowen marsh was angry. jon could see it in his eyes, the tightness around his mouth, the flush to those round cheeks. that red is not from cold. please sit, he said. may i offer you food or drink? we broke our fast in the commons, said marsh. i could do with more. yarwyck eased himself down onto a chair. good of you to offer. perhaps some wine? said septon cellador. corn, screamed the raven from the lintel. corn, corn. wine for the septon and a plate for our first builder, jon told dolorous edd. nothing for the bird. he turned back to his visitors. you're here about val. and other matters, said bowen marsh. the men have concerns, my lord. and who is it who appointed you to speak for them? as do i. othell, how goes the work at the nightfort? i have had a letter from ser axell florent, who styles himself the queen's hand. he tells me that queen selyse is not pleased with her quarters at eastwatch-by-the-sea and wishes to move into her husband's new seat at once. will that be possible? yarwyck shrugged. we've got most of the keep restored and put a roof back on the kitchens. she'd need food and furnishings and firewood, mind you, but it might serve. not so many comforts as eastwatch, to be sure. and a long way from the ships, should her grace wish to leave us, but ... aye, she could live there, though it will be years before the place looks a proper castle. sooner if i had more builders. i could offer you a giant. that gave othell a start. the monster in the yard? his name is wun weg wun dar wun, leathers tells me. a lot to wrap a tongue around, i know. leathers calls him wun wun, and that seems to serve. wun wun was very little like the giants in old nan's tales, those huge savage creatures who mixed blood into their morning porridge and devoured whole bulls, hair and hide and horns. this giant ate no meat at all, though he was a holy terror when served a basket of roots, crunching onions and turnips and even raw hard neeps between his big square teeth. he's a willing worker, though getting him to understand what you want is not always easy. he speaks the old tongue after a fashion, but nothing of the common. tireless, though, and his strength is prodigious. he could do the work of a dozen men. i ... my lord, the men would never ... giants eat human flesh, i think ... no, my lord, i thank you, but i do not have the men to watch over such a creature, he ... jon snow was unsurprised. as you wish. we will keep the giant here. truth be told, he would have been loath to part with wun wun. you know nothing, jon snow, ygritte might say, but jon spoke with the giant whenever he could, through leathers or one of the free folk they had brought back from the grove, and was learning much and more about his people and their history. he only wished that sam were here to write the stories down. that was not to say that he was blind to the danger wun wun represented. the giant would lash out violently when threatened, and those huge hands were strong enough to rip a man apart. he reminded jon of hodor. hodor twice as big, twice as strong, and half as clever. there's a thought to sober even septon cellador. but if tormund has giants with him, wun weg wun dar wun may help us treat with them. mormont's raven muttered his annoyance as the door opened beneath him, heralding the return of dolorous edd with a flagon of wine and a plate of eggs and sausages. bowen marsh waited with obvious impatience as edd poured, resuming only when he left again. tollett is a good man, and well liked, and iron emmett has been a fine master-at-arms, he said then. yet the talk is that you mean to send them away. we need good men at long barrow. whore's hole, the men have started calling it, said marsh, but be that as it may. is it true that you mean to replace emmett with this savage leathers as our master-at-arms? that is an office most oft reserved for knights, or rangers at the least. leathers is savage, jon agreed mildly. i can attest to that. i've tried him in the practice yard. he's as dangerous with a stone axe as most knights are with castle-forged steel. i grant you, he is not as patient as i'd like, and some of the boys are terrified of him ... but that's not all for the bad. one day they'll find themselves in a real fight, and a certain familiarity with terror will serve them well. he's a wildling. he was, until he said the words. now he is our brother. one who can teach the boys more than swordcraft. it would not hurt them to learn a few words of the old tongue and something of the ways of the free folk. free, the raven muttered. corn. king. the men do not trust him. which men? jon might have asked. how many? but that would lead him down a road he did not mean to ride. i am sorry to hear that. is there more? septon cellador spoke up. this boy satin. it's said you mean to make him your steward and squire, in tollett's place. my lord, the boy's a whore ... a ... dare i say ... a painted catamite from the brothels of old-town. and you are a drunk. what he was in oldtown is none of our concern. he's quick to learn and very clever. the other recruits started out despising him, but he won them over and made friends of them all. he's fearless in a fight and can even read and write after a fashion. he should be capable of fetching me my meals and saddling my horse, don't you think? most like, said bowen marsh, stony-faced, but the men do not like it. traditionally the lord commander's squires are lads of good birth being groomed for command. does my lord believe the men of the night's watch would ever follow a whore into battle? jon's temper flashed. they have followed worse. the old bear left a few cautionary notes about certain of the men, for his successor. we have a cook at the shadow tower who was fond of raping septas. he burned a seven-pointed star into his flesh for every one he claimed. his left arm is stars from wrist to elbow, and stars mark his calves as well. at eastwatch we have a man who set his father's house afire and barred the door. his entire family burned to death, all nine. whatever satin may have done in oldtown, he is our brother now, and he will be my squire. septon cellador drank some wine. othell yarwyck stabbed a sausage with his dagger. bower marsh sat red-faced. the raven flapped its wings and said, corn, corn, kill. finally the lord steward cleared his throat. your lordship knows best, i am sure. might i ask about these corpses in the ice cells? they make the men uneasy. and to keep them under guard? surely that is a waste of two good men, unless you fear that they ... ... will rise? i pray they do. septon cellador paled. seven save us. wine dribbled down his chin in a red line. lord commander, wights are monstrous, unnatural creatures. abominations before the eyes of the gods. you ... you cannot mean to try to talk with them? can they talk? asked jon snow. i think not, but i cannot claim to know. monsters they may be, but they were men before they died. how much remains? the one i slew was intent on killing lord commander mormont. plainly it remembered who he was and where to find him. maester aemon would have grasped his purpose, jon did not doubt; sam tarly would have been terrified, but he would have understood as well. my lord father used to tell me that a man must know his enemies. we understand little of the wights and less about the others. we need to learn. that answer did not please them. septon cellador fingered the crystal that hung about his neck and said, i think this most unwise, lord snow. i shall pray to the crone to lift her shining lamp and lead you down the path of wisdom. jon snow's patience was exhausted. we could all do with a bit more wisdom, i am sure. you know nothing, jon snow. now, shall we speak of va i? it is true, then? said marsh. you have released her. beyond the wall. septon cellador sucked in his breath. the king's prize. his grace will be most wroth to find her gone. val will return. before stannis, if the gods are good. how can you know that? demanded bowen marsh. she said she would. and if she lied? if she meets with misadventure? why, then, you may have a chance to choose a lord commander more to your liking. until such time, i fear you'll still need to suffer me. jon took a swallow of ale. i sent her to find tormund giantsbane and bring him my offer. if we may know, what offer is this? the same offer i made at mole's town. food and shelter and peace, if he will join his strength to ours, fight our common enemy, help us hold the wall. bowen marsh did not appear surprised. you mean to let him pass. his voice suggested he had known all along. to open the gates for him and his followers. hundreds, thousands. if he has that many left. septon cellador made the sign of the star. othell yarwyck grunted. bowen marsh said, some might call this treason. these are wildlings. savages, raiders, rapers, more beast than man. tormund is none of those things, said jon, no more than mance rayder. but even if every word you said was true, they are still men, bowen. living men, human as you and me. winter is coming, my lords, and when it does, we living men will need to stand together against the dead. snow, screamed lord mormont's raven. snow, snow. jon ignored him. we have been questioning the wildlings we brought back from the grove. several of them told an interesting tale, of a woods witch called mother mole. mother mole? said bowen marsh. an unlikely name. supposedly she made her home in a burrow beneath a hollow tree. whatever the truth of that, she had a vision of a fleet of ships arriving to carry the free folk to safety across the narrow sea. thousands of those who fled the battle were desperate enough to believe her. mother mole has led them all to hardhome, there to pray and await salvation from across the sea. othell yarwyck scowled. i'm no ranger, but ... hardhome is an un-holy place, it's said. cursed. even your uncle used to say as much, lord snow. why would they go there? jon had a map before him on the table. he turned it so they could see. hardhome sits on a sheltered bay and has a natural harbor deep enough for the biggest ships afloat. wood and stone are plentiful near there. the waters teem with fish, and there are colonies of seals and sea cows close at hand. all that's true, i don't doubt, said yarwyck, but it's not a place i'd want to spend a night. you know the tale. he did. hardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the wall, until the night six hundred years ago when hell had swallowed it. its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north. afterward ashes rained down on haunted forest and shivering sea alike for almost half a year. traders reported finding only nightmarish devastation where hardhome had stood, a landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses, blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement. six centuries had come and gone since that night, but hardhome was still shunned. the wild had reclaimed the site, jon had been told, but rangers claimed that the overgrown ruins were haunted by ghouls and demons and burning ghosts with an unhealthy taste for blood. it is not the sort of refuge i'd chose either, jon said, but mother mole was heard to preach that the free folk would find salvation where once they found damnation. septon cellador pursed his lips. salvation can be found only through the seven. this witch has doomed them all. and saved the wall, mayhaps, said bowen marsh. these are enemies we speak of. let them pray amongst the ruins, and if their gods send ships to carry them off to a better world, well and good. in this world i have no food to feed them. jon flexed the fingers of his sword hand. cotter pyke's galleys sail past hardhome from time to time. he tells me there is no shelter there but the caves. the screaming caves, his men call them. mother mole and those who followed her will perish there, of cold and starvation. hundreds of them. thousands. thousands of enemies. thousands of wildlings. thousands of people, jon thought. men, women, children. anger rose inside him, but when he spoke his voice was quiet and cold. are you so blind, or is it that you do not wish to see? what do you think will happen when all these enemies are dead? above the door the raven muttered, dead, dead, dead. let me tell you what will happen, jon said. the dead will rise again, in their hundreds and their thousands. they will rise as wights, with black hands and pale blue eyes, and they will come for us. he pushed himself to his feet, the fingers of his sword hand opening and closing. you have my leave to go. septon cellador rose grey-faced and sweating, othell yarwyck stiffly, bowen marsh tight-lipped and pale. thank you for your time, lord snow. they left without another word. queen selyse descended upon castle black with her daughter and her daughter's fool, her serving girls and lady companions, and a retinue of knights, sworn swords, and men-at-arms fifty strong. queen's men all, jon snow knew. they may attend selyse, but it is melisandre they serve. the red priestess had warned him of their coming almost a day before the raven arrived from eastwatch with the same message. he met the queen's party by the stables, accompanied by satin, bowen marsh, and half a dozen guards in long black cloaks. it would never do to come before this queen without a retinue of his own, if half of what they said of her was true. she might mistake him for a stableboy and hand him the reins of her horse. the snows had finally moved off to the south and given them a respite. there was even a hint of warmth in the air as jon snow took a knee before this southron queen. your grace. castle black welcomes you and yours. queen selyse looked down at him. my thanks. please escort me to your lord commander. my brothers chose me for that honor. i am jon snow. you? they said you were young, but ... queen selyse's face was pinched and pale. she wore a crown of red gold with points in the shape of flames, a twin to that worn by stannis. ... you may rise, lord snow. this is my daughter, shireen. princess. jon inclined his head. shireen was a homely child, made even uglier by the greyscale that had left her neck and part of her cheek stiff and grey and cracked. my brothers and i are at your service, he told the girl. shireen reddened. thank you, my lord. i believe you are acquainted with my kinsman, ser axell florent? the queen went on. only by raven. and report. the letters he'd received from eastwatch-by-the-sea had a deal to say of axell florent, very little of it good. ser axell. lord snow. a stout man, florent had short legs and a thick chest. coarse hair covered his cheeks and jowls and poked from his ears and nostrils. my loyal knights, queen selyse went on. ser narbert, ser benethon, ser brus, ser patrek, ser dorden, ser malegorn, ser lambert, ser perkin. each worthy bowed in turn. she did not trouble to name her fool, but the cowbells on his antlered hat and the motley tattooed across his puffy cheeks made him hard to overlook. patchface. cotter pyke's letters had made mention of him as well. pyke claimed he was a simpleton. then the queen beckoned to another curious member of her entourage: a tall gaunt stick of a man, his height accentuated by an outlandish three-tiered hat of purple felt. and here we have the honorable tycho nestoris, an emissary of the iron bank of braavos, come to treat with his grace king stannis. the banker doffed his hat and made a sweeping bow. lord commander. i thank you and your brothers for your hospitality. he spoke the common tongue flawlessly, with only the slightest hint of accent. half a foot taller than jon, the braavosi sported a beard as thin as a rope sprouting from his chin and reaching almost to his waist. his robes were a somber purple, trimmed with ermine. a high stiff collar framed his narrow face. i hope we shall not inconvenience you too greatly. not at all, my lord. you are most welcome. more welcome than this queen, if truth be told. cotter pyke had sent a raven ahead to advise them of the banker's coming. jon snow had thought of little since. jon turned back to the queen. the royal chambers in the king's tower have been prepared for your grace for so long as you wish to remain with us. this is our lord steward, bowen marsh. he will find quarters for your men. how kind of you to make room for us. the queen's words were courteous enough, though her tone said, it is no more than your duty, and you had best hope these quarters please me. we will not be with you long. a few days at the most. it is our intent to press on to our new seat at the nightfort as soon as we are rested. the journey from eastwatch was wearisome. as you say, your grace, said jon. you will be cold and hungry, i am sure. a hot meal awaits you in our common room. very good. the queen glanced about the yard. first, though, we wish to consult with the lady melisandre. of course, your grace. her apartments are in the king's tower as well. this way, if you will? queen selyse nodded, took her daughter by the hand, and permitted him to lead them from the stables. ser axell, the braavosi banker, and the rest of her party followed, like so many ducklings done up in wool and fur. your grace, said jon snow, my builders have done all they can to make the nightfort ready to receive you ... yet much of it remains in ruins. it is a large castle, the largest on the wall, and we have only been able to restore a part of it. you might be more comfortable back at eastwatch-by-the-sea. queen selyse sniffed. we are done with eastwatch. we did not like it there. a queen should be mistress beneath her own roof. we found your cotter pyke to be an uncouth and unpleasant man, quarrelsome and niggardly. you should hear what cotter says of you. i am sorry for that, but i fear your grace will find conditions at the nightfort even less to your liking. we speak of a fortress, not a palace. a grim place, and cold. whereas eastwatch— eastwatch is not safe. the queen put a hand on her daughter's shoulder. this is the king's true heir. shireen will one day sit the iron throne and rule the seven kingdoms. she must be kept from harm, and eastwatch is where the attack will come. this nightfort is the place my husband has chosen for our seat, and there we shall abide. we— oh! an enormous shadow emerged from behind the shell of the lord commander's tower. princess shireen gave a shriek, and three of the queen's knights gasped in harmony. another swore. seven save us, he said, quite forgetting his new red god in his shock. don't be afraid, jon told them. there's no harm in him, your grace. this is wun wun. wun weg wun dar wun. the giant's voice rumbled like a boulder crashing down a mountainside. he sank to his knees before them. even kneeling, he loomed over them. kneel queen. little queen. words that leathers had taught him, no doubt. princess shireen's eyes went wide as dinner plates. he's a giant ! a real true giant, like from the stories. but why does he talk so funny? he only knows a few words of the common tongue as yet, said jon. in their own land, giants speak the old tongue. can i touch him? best not, her mother warned. look at him. a filthy creature. the queen turned her frown on jon. lord snow, what is this bestial creature doing on our side of the wall? wun wun is a guest of the night's watch, as you are. the queen did not like that answer. nor did her knights. ser axell grimaced in disgust, ser brus gave a nervous titter, ser narbert said, i had been told all the giants were dead. almost all. ygritte wept for them. in the dark the dead are dancing. patchface shuffled his feet in a grotesque dance step. i know, i know, oh oh oh. at eastwatch someone had sewn him a motley cloak of beaver pelts, sheepskins, and rabbit fur. his hat sported antlers hung with bells and long brown flaps of squirrel fur that hung down over his ears. every step he took set him to ringing. wun wun gaped at him with fascination, but when the giant reached for him the fool hopped back away, jingling. oh no, oh no, oh no. that brought wun wun lurching to his feet. the queen grabbed hold of princess shireen and pulled her back, her knights reached for their swords, and patchface reeled away in alarm, lost his footing, and plopped down on his arse in a snowdrift. wun wun began to laugh. a giant's laughter could put to shame a dragon's roar. patchface covered his ears, princess shireen pressed her face into her mother's furs, and the boldest of the queen's knights moved forward, steel in hand. jon raised an arm to block his path. you do not want to anger him. sheathe your steel, ser. leathers, take wun wun back to hardin's. eat now, wun wun? asked the giant. eat now, jon agreed. to leathers he said, i'll send out a bushel of vegetables for him and meat for you. start a fire. leathers grinned. i will, m'lord, but hardin's is bone cold. perhaps m'lord could send out some wine to warm us? for you. not him. wun wun had never tasted wine until he came to castle black, but once he had, he had taken a gigantic liking to it. too much a liking. jon had enough to contend with just now without adding a drunken giant to the mix. he turned back to the queen's knights. my lord father used to say a man should never draw his sword unless he means to use it. using it was my intent. the knight was clean-shaved and windburnt; beneath a cloak of white fur he wore a cloth-of-silver surcoat emblazoned with a blue five-pointed star. i had been given to understand that the night's watch defended the realm against such monsters. no one mentioned keeping them as pets. another bloody southron fool. you are ... ? ser patrek of king's mountain, if it please my lord. i do not know how you observe guest right on your mountain, ser. in the north we hold it sacred. wun wun is a guest here. ser patrek smiled. tell me, lord commander, should the others turn up, do you plan to offer hospitality to them as well? the knight turned to his queen. your grace, that is the king's tower there, if i am not mistaken. if i may have the honor? as you wish. the queen took his arm and swept past the men of the night's watch with never a second glance. those flames on her crown are the warmest thing about her. lord tycho, jon called. a moment, please. the braavosi halted. no lord i. only a simple servant of the iron bank of braavos. cotter pyke informs me that you came to eastwatch with three ships. a galleas, a galley, and a cog. just so, my lord. the crossing can be perilous in this season. one ship alone may founder, where three together may aid one another. the iron bank is always prudent in such matters. perhaps before you leave we might have a quiet word? i am at your service, lord commander. and in braavos we say there is no time like the present. will that suit? as good as any. shall we repair to my solar, or would you like to seethe top of the wall? the banker glanced up, to where the ice loomed vast and pale against the sky. i fear it will be bitter cold up top. that, and windy. you learn to walk well away from the edge. men have been blown off. still. the wall is like nothing else on earth. you may never have another chance to see it. no doubt i shall rue my caution upon my deathbed, but after a long day in the saddle, a warm room sounds preferable to me. my solar, then. satin, some mulled wine, if you would. jon's rooms behind the armory were quiet enough, if not especially warm. his fire had gone out some time ago; satin was not as diligent in feeding it as dolorous edd had been. mormont's raven greeted them with a shriek of corn! jon hung up his cloak. you come seeking stannis, is that correct? it is, my lord. queen selyse has suggested that we might send word to deepwood motte by raven, to inform his grace that i await his pleasure at the nightfort. the matter that i mean to put to him is too delicate to entrust to letters. a debt. what else could it be? his own debt? or his brother's? the banker pressed his fingers together. it would not be proper for me to discuss lord stannis's indebtedness or lack of same. as to king robert ... it was indeed our pleasure to assist his grace in his need. for so long as robert lived, all was well. now, however, the iron throne has ceased all repayment. could the lannisters truly be so foolish? you cannot mean to hold stannis responsible for his brother's debts. the debts belong to the iron throne, tycho declared, and whoso-ever sits on that chair must pay them. since young king tommen and his counsellors have become so obdurate, we mean to broach the subject with king stannis. should he prove himself more worthy of our trust, it would of course be our great pleasure to lend him whatever help he needs. help, the raven screamed. help, help, help. much of this jon had surmised the moment he learned that the iron bank had sent an envoy to the wall. when last we heard, his grace was marching on winterfell to confront lord bolton and his allies. you may seek him there if you wish, though that carries a risk. you could find yourself caught up in his war. tycho bowed his head. we who serve the iron bank face death full as often as you who serve the iron throne. is that whom i serve? jon snow was no longer certain. i can provide you with horses, provisions, guides, whatever is required to get you as far as deepwood motte. from there you will need to make your own way to stannis. and you may well find his head upon a spike. there will be a price. price, screamed mormont's raven. price, price. there is always a price, is there not? the braavosi smiled. what does the watch require? your ships, for a start. with their crews. all three? how will i return to braavos? i only need them for a single voyage. a hazardous voyage, i assume. for a start, you said? we need a loan as well. gold enough to keep us fed till spring. to buy food and hire ships to bring it to us. spring? tycho sighed. it is not possible, my lord. what was it stannis had said to him? you haggle like a crone with a codfish, lord snow. did lord eddard father you on a fishwife? perhaps he had at that. it took the better part of an hour before the impossible became possible, and another hour before they could agree on terms. the flagon of mulled wine that satin delivered helped them settle the more nettlesome points. by the time jon snow signed the parchment the braavosi drew up, both of them were half-drunk and quite unhappy. jon thought that a good sign. the three braavosi ships would bring the fleet at eastwatch up to eleven, including the ibbenese whaler that cotter pyke had commandeered on jon's order, a trading galley out of pentos similarly impressed, and three battered lysene warships, remnants of salladhor saan's former fleet driven back north by the autumn storms. all three of saan's ships had been in dire need of refitting, but by now the work should be complete. eleven ships was no wise enough, but if he waited any longer, the free folk at hardhome would be dead by the time the rescue fleet arrived. so/7 now or not at all. whether mother mole and her people would be desperate enough to entrust their lives to the night's watch, though ... the day had darkened by the time he and tycho nestoris left the solar. snow had begun to fall. our respite was a brief one, it would seem. jon drew his cloak about himself more tightly. winter is nigh upon us. the day i left braavos, there was ice on the canals. three of my men passed through braavos not long ago, jon told him. an old maester, a singer, and a young steward. they were escorting a wildling girl and her child to oldtown. i do not suppose you chanced to encounter them? i fear not, my lord. westerosi pass through braavos every day, but most come and go from the ragman's harbor. the ships of the iron bank moor at the purple harbor. if you wish, i can make inquiries after them when i return home. no need. by now they should be safe in oldtown. let us hope so. the narrow sea is perilous this time of year, and of late there have been troubling reports of strange ships seen amongst the step-stones. salladhor saan? the lysene pirate? some say he has returned to his old haunts, this is so. and lord redwyne's war fleet creeps through the broken arm as well. on its way home, no doubt. but these men and their ships are well-known to us. no, these other sails ... from farther east, perhaps ... one hears queer talk of dragons. would that we had one here. a dragon might warm things up a bit. my lord jests. you will forgive me if i do not laugh. we braavosi are descended from those who fled valyria and the wroth of its dragonlords. we do not jape of dragons. no, i suppose not. my apologies, lord tycho. none is required, lord commander. now i find that i am hungry. lending such large sums of gold will give a man an appetite. will you be so good as to point me to your feast hall? i will take you there myself. jon gestured. this way. once there, it would have been discourteous not to break bread with the banker, so jon sent satin off to fetch them food. the novelty of newcomers had brought out almost all the men who were not on duty or asleep, so the cellar was crowded and warm. the queen herself was absent, as was her daughter. by now presumably they were settling into the king's tower. but ser brus and ser malegorn were on hand, entertaining such brothers as had gathered with the latest tidings from eastwatch and beyond the sea. three of the queen's ladies sat together, attended by their serving maids and a dozen admiring men of the night's watch. nearer the door, the queen's hand was attacking a brace of capons, sucking the meat off the bones and washing down each bite with ale. when he espied jon snow, axell florent tossed a bone aside, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and sauntered over. with his bowed legs, barrel chest, and prominent ears, he presented a comical appearance, but jon knew better than to laugh at him. he was an uncle to queen selyse and had been among the first to follow her in accepting melisandre's red god. if he is not a kinslayer, he is the next best thing. axell florent's brother had been burned by melisandre, maester aemon had informed him, yet ser axell had done little and less to stop it. what sort of man can stand by idly and watch his own brother being burned alive? nestoris, said ser axell, and the lord commander. might i join you? he lowered himself to the bench before they could reply. lord snow, if i may ask ... this wildling princess his grace king stannis wrote of ... where might she be, my lord? long leagues from here, jon thought. if the gods are good, by now she has found tormund giantsbane. val is the younger sister of dalla, who was mance rayder's wife and mother to his son. king stannis took val and the child captive after dalla died in childbed, but she is no princess, not as you mean it. ser axell shrugged. whatever she may be, at eastwatch men claimed the wench was fair. i'd like to see with mine own eyes. some of these wildling women, well, a man would need to turn them over to do his duty as a husband. if it please the lord commander, bring her out, let us have a look. she is not a horse to be paraded for inspection, ser. i promise not to count her teeth. florent grinned. oh, never fear, i'll treat her with all the courtesy she is due. he knows i do not have her. a village has no secrets, and no more did castle black. val's absence was not spoken of openly, but some men knew, and in the common hall at night the brothers talked. what has he heard? jon wondered. how much does he believe? forgive me, ser, but val will not be joining us. i'll go to her. where do you keep the wench? away from you. somewhere safe. enough, ser. the knight's face grew flushed. my lord, have you forgotten who i am? his breath smelled of ale and onions. must i speak to the queen? a word from her grace and i can have this wildling girl delivered naked to the hall for our inspection. that would be a pretty trick, even for a queen. the queen would never presume upon our hospitality, jon said, hoping that was true. now i fear i must take my leave, before i forget the duties of a host. lord tycho, pray excuse me. yes, of course, the banker said. a pleasure. outside, the snow was coming down more heavily. across the yard the king's tower had turned into a hulking shadow, the lights in its windows obscured by falling snow. back in his solar, jon found the old bear's raven perched on the back of the oak-and-leather chair behind the trestle table. the bird began to scream for food the moment he entered. jon took a fistful of dried kernels from the sack by the door and scattered them on the floor, then claimed the chair. tycho nestoris had left behind a copy of their agreement. jon read it over thrice. that was simple, he reflected. simpler than i dared hope. simpler than it should have been. it gave him an uneasy feeling. braavosi coin would allow the night's watch to buy food from the south when their own stores ran short, food enough to see them through the winter, however long it might prove to be. a long hard winter will leave the watch so deep in debt that we will never climb out, jon reminded himself, but when the choice is debt or death, best borrow. he did not have to like it, though. and come spring, when the time came to repay all that gold, he would like it even less. tycho nestoris had impressed him as cultured and courteous, but the iron bank of braavos had a fearsome reputation when collecting debts. each of the nine free cities had its bank, and some had more than one, fighting over every coin like dogs over a bone, but the iron bank was richer and more powerful than all the rest combined. when princes defaulted on their debts to lesser banks, ruined bankers sold their wives and children into slavery and opened their own veins. when princes failed to repay the iron bank, new princes sprang up from nowhere and took their thrones. as poor plump tommen may be about to learn. no doubt the lannisters had good reason for refusing to honor king robert's debts, but it was folly all the same. if stannis was not too stiff-necked to accept their terms, the braavosi would give him all the gold and silver he required, coin enough to buy a dozen sellsword companies, to bribe a hundred lords, to keep his men paid, fed, clothed, and armed. unless stannis is lying dead beneath the walls of winterfell, he may just have won the iron throne. he wondered if melisandre had seen that in her fires. jon sat back, yawned, stretched. on the morrow he would draft orders for cotter pyke. eleven ships to hardhome. bring back as many as you can, women and children first. it was time they set sail. should i go myself, though, or leave it to cotter? the old bear had led a ranging. aye. and never returned. jon closed his eyes. just for a moment and woke, stiff as a board, with the old bear's raven muttering, snow, snow, and mully shaking him. m'lord, you're wanted. beg pardon, m'lord. a girl's been found. a girl? jon sat, rubbing the sleep from his eyes with the back of his hands. val? has val returned? not val, m'lord. this side of the wall, it were. arya. jon straightened. it had to be her. girl, screamed the raven. girl, girl. ty and dannel came on her two leagues south of mole's town. they were chasing down some wildlings who scampered off down the king-sroad. brought them back as well, but then they come on the girl. she's highborn, m'lord, and she's been asking for you. how many with her? he moved to his basin, splashed water on his face. gods, but he was tired. none, m'lord. she come alone. her horse was dying under her. all skin and ribs it was, lame and lathered. they cut it loose and took the girl for questioning. a grey girl on a dying horse. melisandre's fires had not lied, it would seem. but what had become of mance rayder and his spearwives? where is the girl now? maester aemon's chambers, m'lord. the men of castle black still called it that, though by now the old maester should be warm and safe in oldtown. girl was blue from the cold, shivering like all get out, so ty wanted clydas to have a look at her. that's good. jon felt fifteen years old again. little sister. he rose and donned his cloak. the snow was still falling as he crossed the yard with mully. a golden dawn was breaking in the east, but behind lady melisandre's window in the king's tower a reddish light still flickered. does she never sleep? what game are you playing, priestess? did you have some other task for mance? he wanted to believe it would be arya. he wanted to see her face again, to smile at her and muss her hair, to tell her she was safe. she won't be safe, though. winterfell is burned and broken and there are no more safe places. he could not keep her here with him, no matter how much he might want to. the wall was no place for a woman, much less a girl of noble birth. nor was he about to turn her over to stannis or melisandre. the king would only want to marry her to one of his own men, horpe or massey or godry giantslayer, and the gods alone knew what use the red woman might want to make of her. the best solution he could see would mean dispatching her to eastwatch and asking cotter pyke to put her on a ship to someplace across the sea, beyond the reach of all these quarrelsome kings. it would need to wait until the ships returned from hardhome, to be sure. she could return to braavos with tycho nestoris. perhaps the iron bank could help find some noble family to foster her. braavos was the nearest of the free cities, though ... which made it both the best and the worst choice. lorath or the port oflbben might be safer. wherever he might send her, though, arya would need silver to support her, a roof above her head, someone to protect her. she was only a child. maester aemon's old chambers were so warm that the sudden cloud of steam when mully pulled the door open was enough to blind the both of them. within, a fresh fire was burning in the hearth, the logs crackling and spitting. jon stepped over a puddle of damp clothing. snow, snow, snow, the ravens called down from above. the girl was curled up near the fire, wrapped in a black woolen cloak three times her size and fast asleep. she looked enough like arya to give him pause, but only for a moment. a tall, skinny, coltish girl, all legs and elbows, her brown hair was woven in a thick braid and bound about with strips of leather. she had a long face, a pointy chin, small ears. but she was too old, far too old. this girl is almost of an age with me. has she eaten? jon asked mully. only bread and broth, my lord. clydas rose from a chair. it is best to go slow, maester aemon always said. any more and she might not have been able to digest it. mully nodded. dannel had one o' hobb's sausages and offered her a bite, but she wouldn't touch it. jon could not blame her for that. hobb's sausages were made of grease and salt and things that did not bear thinking about. perhaps we should just let her rest. that was when the girl sat up, clutching the cloak to her small, pale breasts. she looked confused. where ... ? castle black, my lady. the wall. her eyes filled up with tears. i'm here. clydas moved closer. poor child. how old are you? sixteen on my next nameday. and no child, but a woman grown and flowered. she yawned, covered her mouth with the cloak. one bare knee peeked through its folds. you do not wear a chain. are you a maester? no, said clydas, but i have served one. she does look a bit like arya, jon thought. starved and skinny, but her hair's the same color, and her eyes. i am told you have been asking after me. i am— —jon snow. the girl tossed her braid back. my house and yours are bound in blood and honor. hear me, kinsman. my uncle cregan is hard upon my trail. you must not let him take me back to karhold. jon was staring. / know this girl. there was something about her eyes, the way she held herself, the way she talked. for a moment the memory eluded him. then it came. alys karstark. that brought the ghost of a smile to her lips. i was not sure you would remember. i was six the last time you saw me. you came to winterfell with your father. the father robb beheaded. i don't recall what for. she blushed. so i could meet your brother. oh, there was some other pretext, but that was the real reason. i was almost of an age with robb, and my father thought we might make a match. there was a feast. i danced with you and your brother both. he was very courteous and said that i danced beautifully. you were sullen. my father said that was to be expected in a bastard. i remember. it was only half a lie. you're still a little sullen, the girl said, but i will forgive you that if you will save me from my uncle. your uncle ... would that be lord arnolf? he is no lord, alys said scornfully. my brother harry is the rightful lord, and by law i am his heir. a daughter comes before an uncle. uncle arnolf is only castellan. he's my great-uncle, actually, my father's uncle. cregan is his son. i suppose that makes him a cousin, but we always called him uncle. now they mean to make me call him husband. she made a fist. before the war i was betrothed to daryn hornwood. we were only waiting till i flowered to be wed, but the kingslayer killed daryn in the whispering wood. my father wrote that he would find some southron lord to wed me, but he never did. your brother robb cut off his head for killing lannisters. her mouth twisted. i thought the whole reason they marched south was to kill some lannisters. it was ... not so simple as that. lord karstark slew two prisoners, my lady. unarmed boys, squires in a cell. the girl did not seem surprised. my father never bellowed like the greatjon, but he was no less dangerous in his wroth. he is dead now too, though. so is your brother. but you and i are here, still living. is there blood feud between us, lord snow? when a man takes the black he puts his feuds behind him. the night's watch has no quarrel with karhold, nor with you. good. i was afraid ... i begged my father to leave one of my brothers as castellan, but none of them wished to miss the glory and ransoms to be won in the south. now torr and edd are dead. harry was a prisoner at maidenpool when last we heard, but that was almost a year ago. he may be dead as well. i did not know where else to turn but to the last son of eddard stark. why not the king? karhold declared for stannis. my uncle declared for stannis, in hopes it might provoke the lannisters to take poor harry's head. should my brother die, karhold should pass to me, but my uncles want my birthright for their own. once cregan gets a child by me they won't need me anymore. he's buried two wives already. she rubbed away a tear angrily, the way arya might have done it. will you help me? marriages and inheritance are matters for the king, my lady. i will write to stannis on your behalf, but- alys karstark laughed, but it was the laughter of despair. write, but do not look for a reply. stannis will be dead before he gets your message. my uncle will see to that. what do you mean? arnolf is rushing to winterfell, 'tis true, but only so he might put his dagger in your king's back. he cast his lot with roose bolton long ago ... for gold, the promise of a pardon, and poor harry's head. lord stannis is marching to a slaughter. so he cannot help me, and would not even if he could. alys knelt before him, clutching the black cloak. you are my only hope, lord snow. in your father's name, i beg you. protect me. r'hllor, sang melisandre, her arms upraised against the falling snow, you are the light in our eyes, the fire in our hearts, the heat in our loins. yours is the sun that warms our days, yours the stars that guard us in the dark of night. all praise r'hllor, the lord of light, the wedding guests answered in ragged chorus before a gust of ice-cold wind blew their words away. jon snow raised the hood of his cloak. the snowfall was light today, a thin scattering of flakes dancing in the air, but the wind was blowing from the east along the wall, cold as the breath of the ice dragon in the tales old nan used to tell. even melisandre's fire was shivering; the flames huddled down in the ditch, crackling softly as the red priestess sang. only ghost seemed not to feel the chill. alys karstark leaned close to jon. snow during a wedding means a cold marriage. my lady mother always said so. he glanced at queen selyse. there must have been a blizzard the day she and stannis wed. huddled beneath her ermine mantle and surrounded by her ladies, serving girls, and knights, the southron queen seemed a frail, pale, shrunken thing. a strained smile was frozen into place on her thin lips, but her eyes brimmed with reverence. she hates the cold but loves the flames. he had only to look at her to see that. a word from melisandre, and she would walk into the fire willingly, embrace it like a lover. not all her queen's men seemed to share her fervor. ser brus appeared half-drunk, ser malegorn's gloved hand was cupped round the arse of the lady beside him, ser narbert was yawning, and ser patrek of king's mountain looked angry. jon snow had begun to understand why stannis had left them with his queen. the night is dark and filled with terrors, melisandre sang. alone we are born and alone we die, but as we walk through this black vale we draw strength from one another, and from you, our lord. her scarlet silks and satins swirled with every gust of wind. two come forth today to join their lives, so they may face this world's darkness together. fill their hearts with fire, my lord, so they may walk your shining path hand in hand forever. lord of light, protect us, cried queen selyse. other voices echoed the response. melisandre's faithful: pallid ladies, shivering serving girls, ser axell and ser narbert and ser lambert, men-at-arms in iron mail and thenns in bronze, even a few of jon's black brothers. lord of light, bless your children. melisandre's back was to the wall, on one side of the deep ditch where her fire burned. the couple to be joined faced her across the ditch. behind them stood the queen, with her daughter and her tattooed fool. princess shireen was wrapped in so many furs that she looked round, breathing in white puffs through the scarf that covered most of her face. ser axell florent and his queen's men surrounded the royal party. though only a few men of the night's watch had gathered about the ditchfire, more looked down from rooftops and windows and the steps of the great switchback stair. jon took careful note of who was there and who was not. some men had the duty; many just off watch were fast asleep. but others had chosen to absent themselves to show their disapproval. othell yarwyck and bowen marsh were amongst the missing. septon chayle had emerged briefly from the sept, fingering the seven-sided crystal on the thong about his neck, only to retreat inside again once the prayers began. melisandre raised her hands, and the ditchfire leapt upward toward her fingers, like a great red dog springing for a treat. a swirl of sparks rose to meet the snowf lakes coming down. oh, lord of light, we thank you, she sang to the hungry flames. we thank you for brave stannis, by your grace our king. guide him and defend him, r'hllor. protect him from the treacheries of evil men and grant him strength to smite the servants of the dark. grant him strength, answered queen selyse and her knights and ladies. grant him courage. grant him wisdom. alys karstark slipped her arm through jon's. how much longer, lord snow? if i'm to be buried beneath this snow, i'd like to die a woman wed. soon, my lady, jon assured her. soon. we thank you for the sun that warms us, chanted the queen. we thank you for the stars that watch over us in the black of night. we thank you for our hearths and for our torches that keep the savage dark at bay. we thank you for our bright spirits, the fires in our loins and in our hearts. and melisandre said, let them come forth, who would be joined. the flames cast her shadow on the wall behind her, and her ruby gleamed against the paleness of her throat. jon turned to alys karstark. my lady. are you ready? yes. oh, yes. you're not scared? the girl smiled in a way that reminded jon so much of his little sister that it almost broke his heart. let him be scared of me. the snowflakes were melting on her cheeks, but her hair was wrapped in a swirl of lace that satin had found somewhere, and the snow had begun to collect there, giving her a frosty crown. her cheeks were flushed and red, and her eyes sparkled. winter's lady. jon squeezed her hand. the magnar of thenn stood waiting by the fire, clad as if for battle, in fur and leather and bronze scales, a bronze sword at his hip. his receding hair made him look older than his years, but as he turned to watch his bride approach, jon could see the boy in him. his eyes were big as walnuts, though whether it was the fire, the priestess, or the woman that had put the fear in him jon could not say. alys was more right than she knew. who brings this woman to be wed? asked melisandre. i do, said jon. now comes alys of house karstark, a woman grown and flowered, of noble blood and birth. he gave her hand one last squeeze and stepped back to join the others. who comes forth to claim this woman? asked melisandre. me. sigorn slapped his chest. magnar of thenn. sigorn, asked melisandre, will you share your fire with alys, and warm her when the night is dark and full of terrors? i swear me. the magnar's promise was a white cloud in the air. snow dappled his shoulders. his ears were red. by the red god's flames, i warm her all her days. alys, do you swear to share your fire with sigorn, and warm him when the night is dark and full of terrors? till his blood is boiling. her maiden's cloak was the black wool of the night's watch. the karstark sunburst sewn on its back was made of the same white fur that lined it. melisandre's eyes shone as bright as the ruby at her throat. then come to me and be as one. as she beckoned, a wall of flames roared upward, licking at the snowflakes with hot orange tongues. alys karstark took her magnar by the hand. side by side they leapt the ditch. two went into the flames. a gust of wind lifted the red woman's scarlet skirts till she pressed them down again. one emerges. her coppery hair danced about her head. what fire joins, none may put asunder. what fire joins, none may put asunder, came the echo, from queen's men and thenns and even a few of the black brothers. except for kings and uncles, thought jon snow. cregan karstark had turned up a day behind his niece. with him came four mounted men-at-arms, a huntsman, and a pack of dogs, sniffing after lady alys as if she were a deer. jon snow met them on the kingsroad half a league south of mole's town, before they could turn up at castle black, claim guest right, or call for parley. one of karstark's men had loosed a crossbow quarrel at ty and died for it. that left four, and cregan himself. fortunately they had a dozen ice cells. room for all. like so much else, heraldry ended at the wall. the thenns had no family arms as was customary amongst the nobles of the seven kingdoms, so jon told the stewards to improvise. he thought they had done well. the bride's cloak sigorn fastened about lady alys's shoulders showed a bronze disk on a field of white wool, surrounded by flames made with wisps of crimson silk. the echo of the karstark sunburst was there for those who cared to look, but differenced to make the arms appropriate for house thenn. the magnar all but ripped the maiden's cloak from alys's shoulders, but when he fastened her bride's cloak about her he was almost tender. as he leaned down to kiss her cheek, their breath mingled. the flames roared once again. the queen's men began to sing a song of praise. is it done? jon heard satin whisper. done and done, muttered mully, and a good thing. they're wed and i'm half-froze. he was muffled up in his best blacks, woolens so new that they had hardly had a chance to fade yet, but the wind had turned his cheeks as red as his hair. hobb's mulled some wine with cinnamon and cloves. that'll warm us some. what's cloves? asked owen the oaf. the snow had started to descend more heavily and the fire in the ditch was guttering out. the crowd began to break apart and stream from the yard, queen's men, king's men, and free folk alike, all anxious to get out of the wind and the cold. will my lord be feasting with us? mully asked jon snow. shortly. sigorn might take it as a slight if he did not appear. and this marriage is mine own work, after all. i have other matters to attend to first, however. jon crossed to queen selyse, with ghost beside him. his boots crunched through piles of old snow. it was growing ever more time-consuming to shovel out the paths from one building to another; more and more, the men were resorting to the underground passages they called wormways. ... such a beautiful rite, the queen was saying. i could feel our lord's fiery gaze upon us. oh, you cannot know how many times i have begged stannis to let us be wed again, a true joining of body and spirit blessed by the lord of light. i know that i could give his grace more children if we were bound in fire. to give him more children you would first need to get him into your bed. even at the wall, it was common knowledge that stannis baratheon had shunned his wife for years. one could only imagine how his grace had responded to the notion of a second wedding in the midst of his war. jon bowed. if it please your grace, the feast awaits. the queen glanced at ghost suspiciously, then raised her head to jon. to be sure. lady melisandre knows the way. the red priestess spoke up. i must attend my fires, your grace. perhaps r'hllor will vouchsafe me a glimpse of his grace. a glimpse of some great victory, mayhaps. oh. queen selyse looked stricken. to be sure ... let us pray for a vision from our lord ... satin, show her grace to her place, said jon. ser malegorn stepped forward. i will escort her grace to the feast. we shall not require your ... steward. the way the man drew out the last word told jon that he had been considering saying something else. boy? pet? whore? jon bowed again. as you wish. i shall join you shortly. ser malegorn offered his arm, and queen selyse took it stiffly. her other hand settled on her daughter's shoulder. the royal ducklings fell in behind them as they made their way across the yard, marching to the music of the bells on the fool's hat. under the sea the mermen feast on starfish soup, and all the serving men are crabs, patchface proclaimed as they went. i know, i know, oh, oh, oh. melisandre's face darkened. that creature is dangerous. many a time i have glimpsed him in my flames. sometimes there are skulls about him, and his lips are red with blood. a wonder you haven't had the poor man burned. all it would take was a word in the queen's ear, and patchface would feed her fires. you see fools in your fire, but no hint of stannis? when i search for him all i see is snow. the same useless answer. clydas had dispatched a raven to deepwood motte to warn the king of arnolf karstark's treachery, but whether the bird had reached his grace in time jon did not know. the braavosi banker was off in search of stannis as well, accompanied by the guides that jon had given him, but between the war and weather, it would be a wonder if he found him. would you know if the king was dead? jon asked the red priestess. he is not dead. stannis is the lord's chosen, destined to lead the fight against the dark. i have seen it in the flames, read of it in ancient prophecy. when the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, azor ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. dragon-stone is the place of smoke and salt. jon had heard all this before. stannis baratheon was the lord of drag-onstone, but he was not born there. he was born at storm's end, like his brothers. he frowned. and what of mance? is he lost as well? what do your fires show? the same, i fear. only snow. snow. it was snowing heavily to the south, jon knew. only two days' ride from here, the kingsroad was said to be impassable. melisandre knows that too. and to the east, a savage storm was raging on the bay of seals. at last report, the ragtag fleet they had assembled to rescue the free folk from hardhome still huddled at eastwatch-by-the-sea, confined to port by the rough seas. you are seeing cinders dancing in the updraft. i am seeing skulls. and you. i see your face every time i look into the flames. the danger that i warned you of grows very close now. daggers in the dark. i know. you will forgive my doubts, my lady. a grey girl on a dying horse, fleeing from a marriage, that was what you said. i was not wrong. you were not right. alys is not arya. the vision was a true one. it was my reading that was false. i am as mortal as you, jon snow. all mortals err. even lord commanders. mance rayder and his spearwives had not returned, and jon could not help but wonder whether the red woman had lied of a purpose. is she playing her own game? you would do well to keep your wolf beside you, my lord. ghost is seldom far. the direwolf raised his head at the sound of his name. jon scratched him behind the ears. but now you must excuse me. ghost, with me. carved from the base of the wall and closed with heavy wooden doors, the ice cells ranged from small to smaller. some were big enough to allow a man to pace, others so small that prisoners were forced to sit; the smallest were too cramped to allow even that. jon had given his chief captive the largest cell, a pail to shit in, enough furs to keep him from freezing, and a skin of wine. it took the guards some time to open his cell, as ice had formed inside the lock. rusted hinges screamed like damned souls when wick whittlestick yanked the door wide enough for jon to slip through. a faint fecal odor greeted him, though less overpowering than he'd expected. even shit froze solid in such bitter cold. jon snow could see his own reflection dimly inside the icy walls. in one corner of the cell a heap of furs was piled up almost to the height of a man. karstark, said jon snow. wake up. the furs stirred. some had frozen together, and the frost that covered them glittered when they moved. an arm emerged, then a face— brown hair, tangled and matted and streaked with grey, two fierce eyes, a nose, a mouth, a beard. ice caked the prisoner's mustache, clumps of frozen snot. snow. his breath steamed in the air, fogging the ice behind his head. you have no right to hold me. the laws of hospitality— you are no guest of mine. you came to the wall without my leave, armed, to carry off your niece against her will. lady alys was given bread and salt. she is a guest. you are a prisoner. jon let that hang for a moment, then said, your niece is wed. cregan karstark's lips skinned back from his teeth. alys was promised to me. though past fifty, he had been a strong man when he went into the cell. the cold had robbed him of that strength and left him stiff and weak. my lord father— your father is a castellan, not a lord. and a castellan has no right to make marriage pacts. my father, arnolf, is lord of karhold. a son comes before an uncle by all the laws i know. cregan pushed himself to his feet and kicked aside the furs clinging to his ankles. harrion is dead. or will be soon. a daughter comes before an uncle too. if her brother is dead, karhold belongs to lady alys. and she has given her hand in marriage to sigorn, magnar of thenn. a wildling. a filthy, murdering wildling. cregan's hands closed into fists. the gloves that covered them were leather, lined with fur to match the cloak that hung matted and stiff from his broad shoulders. his black wool surcoat was emblazoned with the white sunburst of his house. i see what you are, snow. half a wolf and half a wildling, baseborn get of a traitor and a whore. you would deliver a highborn maid to the bed of some stinking savage. did you sample her yourself first? he laughed. if you mean to kill me, do it and be damned for a kinslayer. stark and karstark are one blood. my name is snow. bastard. guilty. of that, at least. let this magnar come to karhold. we'll hack off his head and stuff it in a privy, so we can piss into his mouth. sigorn leads two hundred thenns, jon pointed out, and lady alys believes karhold will open its gates to her. two of your men have already sworn her their service and confirmed all she had to say concerning the plans your father made with ramsay snow. you have close kin at karhold, i am told. a word from you could save their lives. yield the castle. lady alys will pardon the women who betrayed her and allow the men to take the black. cregan shook his head. chunks of ice had formed about the tangles in his hair, and clicked together softly when he moved. never, he said. never, never, never. / should make his head a wedding gift for ladyalys and her magnar, jon thought, but dare not take the risk. the night's watch took no part in the quarrels of the realm; some would say he had already given stannis too much help. behead this fool, and they will claim i am killing northmen to give their lands to wildlings. release him, and he will do his best to rip apart all i've done with ladyalys and the magnar. jon wondered what his father would do, how his uncle might deal with this. but eddard stark was dead, benjen stark lost in the frozen wilds beyond the wall. you know nothing, jon snow. never is a long time, jon said. you may feel differently on the morrow, or a year from now. soon or late king stannis will return to the wall, however. when he does he will have you put to death ... unless it happens that you are wearing a black cloak. when a man takes the black, his crimes are wiped away. even such a man as you. now pray excuse me. i have a feast to attend. after the biting cold of the ice cells, the crowded cellar was so hot that jon felt suffocated from the moment he came down the steps. the air smelled of smoke and roasting meat and mulled wine. axell florent was making a toast as jon took his place upon the dais. to king stannis and his wife, queen selyse, light of the north! ser axell bellowed. to r'hllor, the lord of light, may he defend us all! one land, one god, one king! one land, one god, one king! the queen's men echoed. jon drank with the rest. whether alys karstark would find any joy in her marriage he could not say, but this one night at least should be one of celebration. the stewards began to bring out the first dish, an onion broth flavored with bits of goat and carrot. not precisely royal fare, but nourishing; it tasted good enough and warmed the belly. owen the oaf took up his fiddle, and several of the free folk joined in with pipes and drums. the same pipes and drums they played to sound mance rayder's attack upon the wall. jon thought they sounded sweeter now. with the broth came loaves of coarse brown bread, warm from the oven. salt and butter sat upon the tables. the sight made jon gloomy. they were well provided with salt, bowen marsh had told him, but the last of the butter would be gone within a moon's turn. old flint and the norrey had been given places of high honor just below the dais. both men had been too old to march with stannis; they had sent their sons and grandsons in their stead. but they had been quick enough to descend on castle black for the wedding. each had brought a wet nurse to the wall as well. the norrey woman was forty, with the biggest breasts jon snow had ever seen. the flint girl was fourteen and flat-chested as a boy, though she did not lack for milk. between the two of them, the child val called monster seemed to be thriving. for that much jon was grateful ... but he did not believe for a moment that two such hoary old warriors would have hied down from their hills for that alone. each had brought a tail of fighting men— five for old flint, twelve for the norrey, all clad in ragged skins and studded leathers, fearsome as the face of winter. some had long beards, some had scars, some had both; all worshiped the old gods of the north, those same gods worshiped by the free folk beyond the wall. yet here they sat, drinking to a marriage hallowed by some queer red god from beyond the seas. better that than refuse to drink. neither flint nor norrey had turned their cups over to spill their wine upon the floor. that might betoken a certain acceptance. or perhaps they just hate to waste good southron wine. they will not have tasted much of it up in those stony hills of theirs. between courses, ser axell florent led queen selyse out onto the floor to dance. others followed— the queen's knights first, partnered with her ladies. ser brus gave princess shireen her first dance, then took a turn with her mother. ser narbert danced with each of selyse's lady companions in turn. the queen's men outnumbered the queen's ladies three to one, so even the humblest serving girls were pressed into the dance. after a few songs some black brothers remembered skills learned at the courts and castles of their youth, before their sins had sent them to the wall, and took the floor as well. that old rogue ulmer of the kingswood proved as adept at dancing as he was at archery, no doubt regaling his partners with his tales of the kingswood brotherhood, when he rode with simon toyne and big belly ben and helped wenda the white fawn burn her mark in the buttocks of her highborn captives. satin was all grace, dancing with three serving girls in turn but never presuming to approach a highborn lady. jon judged that wise. he did not like the way some of the queen's knights were looking at the steward, particularly ser patrek of king's mountain. that one wants to shed a bit of blood, he thought. he is looking for some provocation. when owen the oaf began to dance with patchface the fool, laughter echoed off the vaulted ceiling. the sight made lady alys smile. do you dance often, here at castle black? every time we have a wedding, my lady. you could dance with me, you know. it would be only courteous. you danced with me anon. anon? teased jon. when we were children. she tore off a bit of bread and threw it at him. as you know well. my lady should dance with her husband. my magnar is not one for dancing, i fear. if you will not dance with me, at least pour me some of the mulled wine. as you command. he signaled for a flagon. so, said alys, as jon poured, i am now a woman wed. a wildling husband with his own little wildling army. free folk is what they call themselves. most, at least. thethenns area people apart, though. very old. ygritte had told him that. you know nothing, jon snow. they come from a hidden vale at the north end of the frostfangs, surrounded by high peaks, and for thousands of years they've had more truck with the giants than with other men. it made them different. different, she said, but more like us. aye, my lady. the therms have lords and laws. they know how to kneel. they mine tin and copper for bronze, forge their own arms and armor instead of stealing it. a proud folk, and brave. mance rayder had to best the old magnar thrice before styr would accept him as king-beyond-the-wall. and now they are here, on our side of the wall. driven from their mountain fastness and into my bedchamber. she smiled a wry smile. it is my own fault. my lord father told me i must charm your brother robb, but i was only six and didn't know how. aye, but now you're almost six-and-ten, and we must pray you will know how to charm your new husband. my lady, how do things stand at karhold with your food stores? not well. alys sighed. my father took so many of our men south with him that only the women and young boys were left to bring the harvest in. them, and the men too old or crippled to go off to war. crops withered in the fields or were pounded into the mud by autumn rains. and now the snows are come. this winter will be hard. few of the old people will survive it, and many children will perish as well. it was a tale that any northmen knew well. my father's grandmother was a flint of the mountains, on his mother's side, jon told her. the first flints, they call themselves. they say the other flints are the blood of younger sons, who had to leave the mountains to find food and land and wives. it has always been a harsh life up there. when the snows fall and food grows scarce, their young must travel to the winter town or take service at one castle or the other. the old men gather up what strength remains in them and announce that they are going hunting. some are found come spring. more are never seen again. it is much the same at karhold. that did not surprise him. when your stores begin to dwindle, my lady, remember us. send your old men to the wall, let them say our words. here at least they will not die alone in the snow, with only memories to warm them. send us boys as well, if you have boys to spare. as you say. she touched his hand. karhold remembers. the elk was being carved. it smelled better than jon had any reason to expect. he dispatched a portion to leathers out at hardin's tower, along with three big platters of roast vegetables for wun wun, then ate a healthy slice himself. three-finger hobb's acquitted himself well. that had been a concern. hobb had come to him two nights ago complaining that he'd joined the night's watch to kill wildlings, not to cook for them. besides, i never done no wedding feast, m'lord. black brothers don't never take no wifes. it's in the bloody vows, i swear 'tis. jon was washing the roast down with a sip of mulled wine when clydas appeared at his elbow. a bird, he announced, and slipped a parchment into jon's hand. the note was sealed with a dot of hard black wax. eastwatch, jon knew, even before he broke the seal. the letter had been written by maester harmune; cotter pyke could neither read nor write. but the words were pyke's, set down as he had spoken them, blunt and to the point. calm seas today. eleven ships set sail for hardhome on the morning tide. three braavosi, four lyseni, four of ours. two of the lyseni barely seaworthy. we may drown more wildlings than we save. your command. twenty ravens aboard, and maester harmune. will send reports. i command from talon, tattersalt second on blackbird, ser glendon holds eastwatch. dark wings, dark words? asked alys karstark. no, my lady. this news was long awaited. though the last part troubles me. glendon hewett was a seasoned man and a strong one, a sensible choice to command in cotter pyke's absence. but he was also as much a friend as alliser thorne could boast, and a crony of sorts with janos slynt, however briefly. jon could still recall how hewett had dragged him from his bed, and the feel of his boot slamming into his ribs. not the man i would have chosen. he rolled the parchment up and slipped it into his belt. the fish course was next, but as the pike was being boned lady alys dragged the magnar up onto the floor. from the way he moved it was plain that sigorn had never danced before, but he had drunk enough mulled wine so that it did not seem to matter. a northern maid and a wildling warrior, bound together by the lord of light. ser axell florent slipped into lady alys's vacant seat. her grace approves. i am close to her, my lord, so i know her mind. king stannis will approve as well. unless roose bolton has stuck his head on a spear. not all agree, alas. ser axell's beard was a ragged brush beneath his sagging chin; coarse hair sprouted from his ears and nostrils. ser patrek feels he would have made a better match for lady alys. his lands were lost to him when he came north. there are many in this hall who have lost far more than that, said jon, and more who have given up their lives in service to the realm. ser patrek should count himself fortunate. axell florent smiled. the king might say the same if he were here. yet some provision must be made for his grace's leal knights, surely? they have followed him so far and at such cost. and we must needs bind these wildlings to king and realm. this marriage is a good first step, but i know that it would please the queen to see the wildling princess wed as well. jon sighed. he was weary of explaining that val was no true princess. no matter how often he told them, they never seemed to hear. you are persistent, ser axell, i grant you that. do you blame me, my lord? such a prize is not easily won. a nubile girl, i hear, and not hard to look upon. good hips, good breasts, well made for whelping children. who would father these children? ser patrek? you? who better? we florents have the blood of the old gardener kings in our veins. lady melisandre could perform the rites, as she did for lady alys and the magnar. all you are lacking is a bride. easily remedied. florent's smile was so false that it looked painful. where is she, lord snow? have you moved her to one of your other castles? greyguard or the shadow tower? whore's burrow, with t'other wenches? he leaned close. some say you have her tucked away for your own pleasure. it makes no matter to me, so long as she is not with child. i'll get my own sons on her. if you've broken her to saddle, well ... we are both men of the world, are we not? jon had heard enough. ser axell, if you are truly the queen's hand, i pity her grace. florent's face grew flushed with anger. so it is true. you mean to keep her for yourself, i see it now. the bastard wants his father's seat. the bastard refused his father's seat. if the bastard had wanted val, all he had to do was ask for her. you must excuse me, ser, he said. i need a breath of fresh air. it stinks in here. his head turned. that was a horn. others had heard it too. the music and the laughter died at once. dancers froze in place, listening. even ghost pricked up his ears. did you hear that? queen selyse asked her knights. a warhorn, your grace, said ser narbert. the queen's hand went fluttering to her throat. are we under attack? no, your grace, said ulmer of the kingswood. it's the watchers on the wall, is all. one blast, thought jon snow. rangers returning. then it came again. the sound seemed to fill the cellar. two blasts, said mully. black brothers, northmen, free folk, thenns, queen's men, all of them fell quiet, listening. five heartbeats passed. ten. twenty. then owen the oaf tittered, and jon snow could breathe again. two blasts, he announced. wildlings. val. tormund giantsbane had come at last. he was not a tall man, tormund giantsbane, but the gods had given him a broad chest and massive belly. mance rayder had named him tormund horn-blower for the power of his lungs, and was wont to say that tormund could laugh the snow off mountaintops. in his wroth, his bellows reminded jon of a mammoth trumpeting. that day tormund bellowed often and loudly. he roared, he shouted, he slammed his fist against the table so hard that a flagon of water overturned and spilled. a horn of mead was never far from his hand, so the spittle he sprayed when making threats was sweet with honey. he called jon snow a craven, a liar, and a turncloak, cursed him for a black-hearted buggering kneeler, a robber, and a carrion crow, accused him of wanting to fuck the free folk up the arse. twice he flung his drinking horn at jon's head, though only after he had emptied it. tormund was not the sort of man to waste good mead. jon let it all wash over him. he never raised his own voice nor answered threat with threat, but neither did he give more ground than he had come prepared to give. finally, as the shadows of the afternoon grew long outside the tent, tormund giantsbane— tall-talker, horn-blower, and breaker of ice, tormund thunderfist, husband to bears, mead-king of ruddy hall, speaker to gods and father of hosts— thrust out his hand. done then, and may the gods forgive me. there's a hundred mothers never will, i know. jon clasped the offered hand. the words of his oath rang through his head. / am the sword in the darkness. i am the watcher on the walls. i am the fire that bums against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. and for him a new refrain: / am the guard who opened the gates and let the foe march through. he would have given much and more to know that he was doing the right thing. but he had gone too far to turn back. done and done, he said. tormund's grip was bone-crushing. that much had not changed about him. the beard was the same as well, though the face under that thicket of white hair had thinned considerably, and there were deep lines graven in those ruddy cheeks. mance should have killed you when he had the chance, he said as he did his best to turn jon's hand to pulp and bone. gold for gruel, and boys ... a cruel price. whatever happened to that sweet lad i knew? they made him lord commander. a fair bargain leaves both sides unhappy, i've heard it said. three days? if i live that long. some o' my own will spit on me when they hear these terms. tormund released jon's hand. your crows will grumble too, if i know them. and i ought to. i have killed more o' you black buggers than i can count. it might be best if you did not mention that so loudly when you come south of the wall. har! tormund laughed. that had not changed either; he still laughed easily and often. wise words. i'd not want you crows to peck me to death. he slapped jon's back. when all my folk are safe behind your wall, we'll share a bit o' meat and mead. till then ...the wildling pulled off the band from his left arm and tossed it at jon, then did the same with its twin upon his right. your first payment. had those from my father and him from his. now they're yours, you thieving black bastard. the armbands were old gold, solid and heavy, engraved with the ancient runes of the first men. tormund giantsbane had worn them as long as jon had known him; they had seemed as much a part of him as his beard. the braavosi will melt these down for the gold. that seems a shame. perhaps you ought to keep them. no. i'll not have it said that tormund thunderfist made the free folk give up their treasures whilst he kept his own. he grinned. but i'll keep the ring i wear about me member. much bigger than those little things. on you it'd be a torque. jon had to laugh. you never change. oh, i do. the grin melted away like snow in summer. i am not the man i was at ruddy hall. seen too much death, and worse things too. my sons ... grief twisted tormund's face. dormund was cut down in the battle for the wall, and him still half a boy. one o' your king's knights did for him, some bastard all in grey steel with moths upon his shield. i saw the cut, but my boy was dead before i reached him. and torwynd ... it was the cold claimed him. always sickly, that one. he just up and died one night. the worst o' it, before we ever knew he'd died he rose pale with them blue eyes. had to see to him m'self. that was hard, jon. tears shone in his eyes. he wasn't much of a man, truth be told, but he'd been me little boy once, and i loved him. jon put a hand on his shoulder. i am so sorry. why? weren't your doing. there's blood on your hands, aye, same as mine. but not his. tormund shook his head. i still have two strong sons. your daughter ... ? munda. that brought tormund's smile back. took that longspear ryk to husband, if you believe it. boy's got more cock than sense, you ask me, but he treats her well enough. i told him if he ever hurt her, i'd yank his member off and beat him bloody with it. he gave jon another hearty slap. time you were going back. keep you any longer, they're like to think we ate you. dawn, then. three days from now. the boys first. i heard you the first ten times, crow. a man'd think there was no trust between us. he spat. boys first, aye. mammoths go the long way round. you make sure eastwatch expects them. i'll make sure there's no fighting, nor rushing at your bloody gate. nice and orderly we'll be, ducklings in a row. and me the mother duck. har! tormund led jon from his tent. outside the day was bright and cloudless. the sun had returned to the sky after a fortnight's absence, and to the south the wall rose blue-white and glittering. there was a saying jon had heard from the older men at castle black: the wall has more moods than mad king aerys, they'd say, or sometimes, the wall has more moods than a woman. on cloudy days it looked to be white rock. on moonless nights it was as black as coal. in snowstorms it seemed carved of snow. but on days like this, there was no mistaking it for anything but ice. on days like this the wall shimmered bright as a septon's crystal, every crack and crevasse limned by sunlight, as frozen rainbows danced and died behind translucent ripples. on days like this the wall was beautiful. tormund's eldest son stood near the horses, talking with leathers. tall toregg, he was called amongst the free folk. though he barely had an inch on leathers, he overtopped his father by a foot. hareth, the strapping mole's town boy called horse, huddled near the fire, his back to the other two. he and leathers were the only men jon had brought with him to the parley; any more might have been seen as a sign of fear, and twenty men would have been of no more use than two if tormund had been intent on blood. ghost was the only protection jon needed; the direwolf could sniff out foes, even those who hid their enmity behind smiles. ghost was gone, though. jon peeled off one black glove, put two fingers in his mouth, and whistled. ghost! to me. from above came the sudden sound of wings. mormont's raven flapped from a limb of an old oak to perch upon jon's saddle. corn, it cried. corn, corn, corn. did you follow me as well? jon reached to shoo the bird away but ended up stroking its feathers. the raven cocked its eye at him. snow, it muttered, bobbing its head knowingly. then ghost emerged from between two trees, with val beside him. they look as though they belong together. val was clad all in white; white woolen breeches tucked into high boots of bleached white leather, white bearskin cloak pinned at the shoulder with a carved weirwood face, white tunic with bone fastenings. her breath was white as well ... but her eyes were blue, her long braid the color of dark honey, her cheeks flushed red from the cold. it had been a long while since jon snow had seen a sight so lovely. have you been trying to steal my wolf? he asked her. why not? if every woman had a direwolf, men would be much sweeter. even crows. har! laughed tormund giantsbane. don't bandy words with this one, lord snow, she's too clever for the likes o' you and me. best steal her quick, before toregg wakes up and takes her first. what had that oaf axell florent said of val? a nubile girl, not hard to look upon. good hips, good breasts, well made for whelping children. all true enough, but the wildling woman was so much more. she had proved that by finding tormund where seasoned rangers of the watch had failed. she may not be a princess, but she would make a worthy wife for any lord. but that bridge had been burned a long time ago, and jon himself had thrown the torch. toregg is welcome to her, he announced. i took a vow. she won't mind. will you, girl? val patted the long bone knife on her hip. lord crow is welcome to steal into my bed any night he dares. once he's been gelded, keeping those vows will come much easier for him. har! tormund snorted again. you hear that, toregg? stay away from this one. i have one daughter, don't need another. shaking his head, the wildling chief ducked back inside his tent. as jon scratched ghost behind the ear, toregg brought up val's horse for her. she still rode the grey garron that mully had given her the day she left the wall, a shaggy, stunted thing blind in one eye. as she turned it toward the wall, she asked, how fares the little monster? twice as big as when you left us, and thrice as loud. when he wants the teat, you can hear him wail in eastwatch. jon mounted his own horse. val fell in beside him. so ... i brought you tormund, as i said i would. what now? am i to be returned to my old cell? your old cell is occupied. queen selyse has claimed the king's tower, for her own. do you remember hardin's tower? the one that looks about to collapse? it's looked that way for a hundred years. i've had the top floor made ready for you, my lady. you will have more room than in the king's tower, though you may not be as comfortable. no one has ever called it hardin's palace. i would choose freedom over comfort every time. freedom of the castle you shall have, but i regret to say you must remain a captive. i can promise that you will not be troubled by unwanted visitors, however. my own men guard hardin's tower, not the queen's. and wun wun sleeps in the entry hall. a giant as protector? even dalla could not boast of that. tormund's wildlings watched them pass, peering out from tents and lean-tos beneath leafless trees. for every man of fighting age, jon saw three women and as many children, gaunt-faced things with hollow cheeks and staring eyes. when mance rayder had led the free folk down upon the wall, his followers drove large herds of sheep and goats and swine before them, but now the only animals to be seen were the mammoths. if not for the ferocity of the giants, those would have been slaughtered too, he did not doubt. there was a lot of meat on a mammoth's bones. jon saw signs of sickness too. that disquieted him more than he could say. if tormund's band were starved and sick, what of the thousands who had followed mother mole to hardhome? cotter pyke should reach them soon. if the winds were kind, his fleet might well be on its way back to eastwatch even now, with as many of the free folk as he could cram aboard. how did you fare with tormund? asked val. ask me a year from now. the hard part still awaits me. the part where i convince mine own to eat this meal i've cooked for them. none of them are going to like the taste, i fear. let me help. you have. you brought me tormund. i can do more. why not? thought jon. they are all convinced she is a princess. val looked the part and rode as if she had been born on horseback. a warrior princess, he decided, not some willowy creature who sits up in a tower, brushing her hair and waiting for some knight to rescue her. i must inform the queen of this agreement, he said. you are welcome to come meet her, if you can find it in yourself to bend a knee. it would never do to offend her grace before he even opened his mouth. may i laugh when i kneel? you may not. this is no game. a river of blood runs between our peoples, old and deep and red. stannis baratheon is one of the few who favors admitting wildlings to the realm. i need his queen's support for what i've done. val's playful smile died. you have my word, lord snow. i will be a proper wildling princess for your queen. she is not my queen, he might have said. if truth be told, the day of her departure cannot come too fast for me. and if the gods are good, she will take melisandre with her. they rode the rest of the way in silence, ghost loping at their heels. mormont's raven followed them as far as the gate, then flapped upward as the rest of them dismounted. horse went ahead with a brand to light the way through the icy tunnel. a small crowd of black brothers was waiting by the gate when jon and his companions emerged south of the wall. ulmer of the kingswood was amongst them, and it was the old archer who came forward to speak for the rest. if it please m'lord, the lads were wondering. will it be peace, m'lord? or blood and iron? peace, jon snow replied. three days hence, tormund giantsbane will lead his people through the wall. as friends, not foes. some may even swell our ranks, as brothers. it will be for us to make them welcome. now back to your duties. jon handed the reins of his horse to satin. i must see queen selyse. her grace would take it as a slight if he did not come to her at once. afterward i will have letters to write. bring parchment, quills, and a pot of maester's black to my chambers. then summon marsh, yarwyck, septon cellador, clydas. cellador would be half-drunk, and clydas was a poor substitute for a real maester, but they were what he had. till sam returns. the northmen too. flint and norrey. leathers, you should be there as well. hobb is baking onion pies, said satin. shall i request that they all join you for supper? jon considered. no. ask them to join me atop the wall at sunset. he turned to val. my lady. with me, if you please. the crow commands, the captive must obey. her tone was playful. this queen of yours must be fierce if the legs of grown men give out beneath them when they meet her. should i have dressed in mail instead of wool and fur? these clothes were given to me by dalla, i would sooner not get bloodstains all over them. if words drew blood, you might have cause to fear. i think your clothes are safe enough, my lady. they made their way toward the king's tower, along fresh-shoveled pathways between mounds of dirty snow. i have heard it said that your queen has a great dark beard. jon knew he should not smile, but he did. only a mustache. very wispy. you can count the hairs. how disappointing. for all her talk about wanting to be mistress of her seat, selyse baratheon seemed in no great haste to abandon the comforts of castle black for the shadows of the nightfort. she kept guards, of course— four men posted at the door, two outside on the steps, two inside by the brazier. commanding them was ser patrekof king's mountain, clad in his knightly raiment of white and blue and silver, his cloak a spatter of five-pointed stars. when presented to val, the knight sank to one knee to kiss her glove. you are even lovelier than i was told, princess, he declared. the queen has told me much and more of your beauty. how odd, when she has never seen me. val patted ser patrek on the head. up with you now, ser kneeler. up, up. she sounded as if she were talking to a dog. it was all that jon could do not to laugh. stone-faced, he told the knight that they required audience with the queen. ser patrek sent one of the men-at-arms scrambling up the steps to inquire as to whether her grace would receive them. the wolf stays here, though, ser patrek insisted. jon had expected that. the direwolf made queen selyse anxious, almost as much as wun weg wun darwun. ghost, stay. they found her grace sewing by the fire, whilst her fool danced about to music only he could hear, the cowbells on his antlers clanging. the crow, the crow, patchface cried when he saw jon. under the sea the crows are white as snow, i know, i know, oh, oh, oh. princess shireen was curled up in a window seat, her hood drawn up to hide the worst of the greyscale that had disfigured her face. there was no sign of lady melisandre. for that much jon was grateful. soon or late he would need to face the red priestess, but he would sooner it was not in the queen's presence. your grace. he took a knee. val did likewise. queen selyse set aside her sewing. you may rise. if it please your grace, may i present the lady val? her sister dalla was— —mother to that squalling babe who keeps us awake at night. i know who she is, lord snow. the queen sniffed. you are fortunate that she returned to us before the king my husband, else it might have gone badly for you. very badly indeed. are you the wildling princess? shireen asked val. some call me that, said val. my sister was wife to mance rayder, the king-beyond-the-wall. she died giving him a son. i'm a princess too, shireen announced, but i never had a sister. i used to have a cousin once, before he sailed away. he was just a bastard, but i liked him. honestly, shireen, her mother said. i am sure the lord commander did not come to hear about robert's by-blows. patchface, be a good fool and take the princess to her room. the bells on his hat rang. away, away, the fool sang. come with me beneath the sea, away, away, away. he took the little princess by one hand and drew her from the room, skipping. jon said, your grace, the leader of the free folk has agreed to my terms. queen selyse gave the tiniest of nods. it was ever my lord husband's wish to grant sanctuary to these savage peoples. so long as they keep the king's peace and the king's laws, they are welcome in our realm. she pursed her lips. i am told they have more giants with them. val answered. almost two hundred of them, your grace. and more than eighty mammoths. the queen shuddered. dreadful creatures. jon could not tell if she was speaking of the mammoths or the giants. though such beasts might be useful to my lord husband in his battles. that may be, your grace, jon said, but the mammoths are too big to pass through our gate. cannot the gate be widened? that ... that would be unwise, i think. selyse sniffed. if you say so. no doubt you know about such things. where do you mean to settle these wildlings? surely mole's town is not large enough to contain ... how many are they? four thousand, your grace. they will help us garrison our abandoned castles, the better to defend the wall. i had been given to understand that those castles were ruins. dismal places, bleak and cold, hardly more than heaps of rubble. at eastwatch we heard talk of rats and spiders. the cold will have killed the spiders by now, thought jon, and the rats may be a useful source of meat come winter. all true, your grace ... but even ruins offer some shelter. and the wall will stand between them and the others. i see you have considered all this carefully, lord snow. i am sure king stannis will be pleased when he returns triumphant from his battle. assuming he returns at all. of course, the queen went on, the wildlings must first acknowledge stannis as their king and r'hllor as their god. and here we are, face-to-face in the narrow passage. your grace, forgive me. those were not the terms that we agreed to. the queen's face hardened. a grievous oversight. what faint traces of warmth her voice had held vanished all at once. free folk do not kneel, val told her. then they must be knelt, the queen declared. do that, your grace, and we will rise again at the first chance, val promised. rise with blades in hand. the queen's lips tightened, and her chin gave a small quiver. you are insolent. i suppose that is only to be expected of a wildling. we must find you a husband who can teach you courtesy. the queen turned her glare on jon. i do not approve, lord commander. nor will my lord husband. i cannot prevent you from opening your gate, as we both know full well, but i promise you that you shall answer for it when the king returns from battle. mayhaps you might want to reconsider. your grace. jon knelt again. this time val did not join him. i am sorry my actions have displeased you. i did as i thought best. do i have your leave to go? you do. at once. once outside and well away from the queen's men, val gave vent to her wroth. you lied about her beard. that one has more hair on her chin than i have between my legs. and the daughter ... her face ... greyscale. the grey death is what we call it. it is not always mortal in children. north of the wall it is. hemlock is a sure cure, but a pillow or a blade will work as well. if i had given birth to that poor child, i would have given her the gift of mercy long ago. this was a val that jon had never seen before. princess shireen is the queen's only child. i pity both of them. the child is not clean. if stannis wins his war, shireen will stand as heir to the iron throne. then i pity your seven kingdoms. the maesters say greyscale is not— the maesters may believe what they wish. ask a woods witch if you would know the truth. the grey death sleeps, only to wake again. the child is not clean! she seems a sweet girl. you cannot know— i can. you know nothing, jon snow. val seized his arm. i want the monster out of there. him and his wet nurses. you cannot leave them in that same tower as the dead girl. jon shook her hand away. she is not dead. she is. her mother cannot see it. nor you, it seems. yet death is there. she walked away from him, stopped, turned back. i brought you tormund giantsbane. bring me my monster. if i can, i will. do. you owe me a debt, jon snow. jon watched her stride away. she is wrong. she must be wrong. greyscale is not so deadly as she claims, not in children. ghost was gone again. the sun was low in the west. a cup of hot spiced wine would serve me well just now. two cups would serve me even better. but that would have to wait. he had foes to face. foes of the worst sort: brothers. he found leathers waiting for him by the winch cage. the two of them rode up together. the higher they went, the stronger the wind. fifty feet up, the heavy cage began to sway with every gust. from time to time it scraped against the wall, starting small crystalline showers of ice that sparkled in the sunlight as they fell. they rose above the tallest towers of the castle. at four hundred feet the wind had teeth, and tore at his black cloak so it slapped noisily at the iron bars. at seven hundred it cut right through him. the wall is mine, jon reminded himself as the winchmen were swinging in the cage, for two more days, at least. jon hopped down onto the ice, thanked the men on the winch, and nodded to the spearmen standing sentry. both wore woolen hoods pulled down over their heads, so nothing could be seen of their faces but their eyes, but he knew ty by the tangled rope of greasy black hair falling down his back and owen by the sausage stuffed into the scabbard at his hip. he might have known them anyway, just by the way they stood. a good lord must know his men, his father had once told him and robb, back at winterfell. jon walked to the edge of the wall and gazed down upon the killing ground where mance rayder's host had died. he wondered where mance was now. did he ever find you, little sister? or were you just a ploy he used so i would set him free? it had been so long since he had last seen arya. what would she look like now? would he even know her? arya underfoot. her face was always dirty. would she still have that little sword he'd had mikken forge for her? stick them with the pointy end, he'd told her. wisdom for her wedding night if half of what he heard of ramsay snow was true. bring her home, mance. i saved your son from melisandre, and now i am about to save four thousand of your free folk. you owe me this one little girl. in the haunted forest to the north, the shadows of the afternoon crept through the trees. the western sky was a blaze of red, but to the east the first stars were peeking out. jon snow flexed the fingers of his sword hand, remembering all he'd lost. sam, you sweet fat fool, you played me a cruel jape when you made me lord commander. a lord commander has no friends. lord snow? said leathers. the cage is coming up. i hear it. jon moved back from the edge. first to make the ascent were the clan chiefs flint and norrey, clad in fur and iron. the norrey looked like some old fox— wrinkled and slight of build, but sly-eyed and spry. torghen flint was half a head shorter but must weigh twice as much— a stout gruff man with gnarled, red-knuckled hands as big as hams, leaning heavily on a blackthorn cane as he limped across the ice. bowen marsh came next, bundled up in a bearskin. after him othell yarwyck. then septon cellador, half in his cups. walk with me, jon told them. they walked west along the wall, down gravel-strewn paths toward the setting sun. when they had come fifty yards from the warming shed, he said, you know why i've summoned you. three days hence at dawn the gate will open, to allow tormund and his people through the wall. there is much we need to do in preparation. silence greeted his pronouncement. then othell yarwyck said, lord commander, there are thousands of— —scrawny wildlings, bone weary, hungry, far from home. jon pointed at the lights of their campfires. there they are. four thousand, tormund claims. three thousand, i make them, by the fires. bowen marsh lived for counts and measures. more than twice that number at hardhome with the woods witch, we are told. and ser denys writes of great camps in the mountains beyond the shadow tower ... jon did not deny it. tormund says the weeper means to try the bridge of skulls again. the old pomegranate touched his scar. he had gotten it defending the bridge of skulls the last time the weeping man had tried to cut his way across the gorge. surely the lord commander cannot mean to allow that ... that demon through as well? not gladly. jon had not forgotten the heads the weeping man had left him, with bloody holes where their eyes had been. blackjack bulwer, hairy hal, garth greyfeather. i cannot avenge them, but i will not forget their names. but yes, my lord, him as well. we cannot pick and choose amongst the free folk, saying this one may pass, this one may not. peace means peace for all. the norrey hawked and spat. as well make peace with wolves and carrion crows. it's peaceful in my dungeons, grumbled old flint. give the weeping man to me. how many rangers has the weeper killed? asked othell yarwyck. how many women has he raped or killed or stolen? three of mine own ilk, said old flint. and he blinds the girls he does not take. when a man takes the black, his crimes are forgiven, jon reminded them. if we want the free folk to fight beside us, we must pardon their past crimes as we would for our own. the weeper will not say the words, insisted yarwyck. he will not wear the cloak. even other raiders do not trust him. you need not trust a man to use him. else how could i make use of all of you? we need the weeper, and others like him. who knows the wild better than a wildling? who knows our foes better than a man who has fought them? all the weeper knows is rape and murder, said yarwyck. once past the wall, the wildlings will have thrice our numbers, said bowen marsh. and that is only tormund's band. add the weeper's men and those at hardhome, and they will have the strength to end the night's watch in a single night. numbers alone do not win a war. you have not seen them. half of them are dead on their feet. i would sooner have them dead in the ground, said yarwyck. if it please my lord. it does not please me. jon's voice was as cold as the wind snapping at their cloaks. there are children in that camp, hundreds of them, thousands. women as well. spearwives. some. along with mothers and grandmothers, widows and maids ... would you condemn them all to die, my lord? brothers should not squabble, septon cellador said. let us kneel and pray to the crone to light our way to wisdom. lord snow, said the norrey, where do you mean to put these wild-lings o' yours? not on my lands, i hope. aye, declared old flint. you want them in the gift, that's your folly, but see they don't wander off or i'll send you back their heads. winter is nigh, i want no more mouths to feed. the wildlings will remain upon the wall, jon assured them. most will be housed in one of our abandoned castles. the watch now had garrisons at icemark, long barrow, sable hall, greyguard, and deep lake, all badly undermanned, but ten castles still stood empty and abandoned. men with wives and children, all orphan girls and any orphan boys below the age of ten, old women, widowed mothers, any woman who does not care to fight. the spearwives we'll send to long barrow to join their sisters, single men to the other forts we've reopened. those who take the black will remain here, or be posted to eastwatch or the shadow tower. tormund will take oakenshield as his seat, to keep him close at hand. bowen marsh sighed. if they do not slay us with their swords, they will do so with their mouths. pray, how does the lord commander propose to feed tormund and his thousands? jon had anticipated that question. through eastwatch. we will bring in food by ship, as much as might be required. from the riverlands and the stormlands and the vale of arryn, from dome and the reach, across the narrow sea from the free cities. and this food will be paid for ... how, if i may ask? with gold, from the iron bank of braavos, jon might have replied. instead he said, i have agreed that the free folk may keep their furs and pelts. they will need those for warmth when winter comes. all other wealth they must surrender. gold and silver, amber, gemstones, carvings, anything of value. we will ship it all across the narrow sea to be sold in the free cities. all the wealth o' the wildlings, said the norrey. that should buy you a bushel o' barleycorn. two bushels, might be. lord commander, why not demand that the wildlings give up their arms as well? asked clydas. leathers laughed at that. you want the free folk to fight beside you against the common foe. how are we to do that without arms? would you have us throw snowballs at the wights? or will you give us sticks to hit them with? the arms most wildlings carry are little more than sticks, thought jon. wooden clubs, stone axes, mauls, spears with fire-hardened points, knives of bone and stone and dragonglass, wicker shields, bone armor, boiled leather. the thenns worked bronze, and raiders like the weeper carried stolen steel and iron swords looted off some corpse ... but even those were oft of ancient vintage, dinted from years of hard use and spotted with rust. tormund giantsbane will never willingly disarm his people, jon said. he is not the weeping man, but he is no craven either. if i had asked that of him, it would have come to blood. the norrey fingered his beard. you may put your wildlings in these ruined forts, lord snow, but how will you make them stay? what is there to stop them moving south to fairer, warmer lands? our lands, said old flint. tormund has given me his oath. he will serve with us until the spring. the weeper and their other captains will swear the same or we will not let them pass. old flint shook his head. they will betray us. the weeper's word is worthless, said othell yarwyck. these are godless savages, said septon cellador. even in the south the treachery of wildlings is renowned. leathers crossed his arms. that battle down below? i was on t'other side, remember? now i wear your blacks and train your boys to kill. some might call me turncloak. might be so ... but i am no more savage than you crows. we have gods too. the same gods they keep in winterfell. the gods of the north, since before this wall was raised, said jon. those are the gods that tormund swore by. he will keep his word. i know him, as i knew mance rayder. i marched with them for a time, you may recall. i had not forgotten, said the lord steward. no, thought jon, i did not think you had. mance rayder swore an oath as well, marsh went on. he vowed to wear no crowns, take no wife, father no sons. then he turned his cloak, did all those things, and led a fearsome host against the realm. it is the remnants of that host that waits beyond the wall. broken remnants. a broken sword can be reforged. a broken sword can kill. the free folk have neither laws nor lords, jon said, but they love their children. will you admit that much? it is not their children who concern us. we fear the fathers, not the sons. as do i. so i insisted upon hostages. i am not the trusting fool you take me for ... nor am i half wildling, no matter what you believe. one hundred boys between the ages of eight and sixteen. a son from each of their chiefs and captains, the rest chosen by lot. the boys will serve as pages and squires, freeing our own men for other duties. some may choose to take the black one day. queerer things have happened. the rest will stand hostage for the loyalty of their sires. the northmen glanced at one another. hostages, mused the norrey. tormund has agreed to this? it was that, or watch his people die. my blood price, he called it, said jon snow, but he will pay. aye, and why not? old flint stomped his cane against the ice. wards, we always called them, when winterfell demanded boys of us, but they were hostages, and none the worse for it. none but them whose sires displeased the kings o' winter, said the norrey. those came home shorter by a head. so you tell me, boy ... if these wildling friends o' yours prove false, do you have the belly to do what needs be done? askjanos slynt. tormund giantsbane knows better than to try me. i may seem a green boy in your eyes, lord norrey, but i am still a son of eddard stark. yet even that did not appease his lord steward. you say these boys will serve as squires. surely the lord commander does not mean they will be trained of arms? jon's anger flared. no, my lord, i mean to set them to sewing lacy smallclothes. of course they shall be trained at arms. they shall also churn butter, hew firewood, muck stables, empty chamber pots, and run messages ... and in between they will be drilled with spear and sword and longbow. marsh flushed a deeper shade of red. the lord commander must pardon my bluntness, but i have no softer way to say this. what you propose is nothing less than treason. for eight thousand years the men of the night's watch have stood upon the wall and fought these wildlings. now you mean to let them pass, to shelter them in our castles, to feed them and clothe them and teach them how to fight. lord snow, must i remind you? you swore an oath. i know what i swore. jon said the words. / am the sword in the darkness. i am the watcher on the walls. i am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. were those the same words you said when you took your vows? they were. as the lord commander knows. are you certain that i have not forgotten some? the ones about the king and his laws, and how we must defend every foot of his land and cling to each ruined castle? how does that part go? jon waited for an answer. none came. / am the shield that guards the realms of men. those are the words. so tell me, my lord— what are these wildlings, if not men? bowen marsh opened his mouth. no words came out. a flush crept up his neck. jon snow turned away. the last light of the sun had begun to fade. he watched the cracks along the wall go from red to grey to black, from streaks of fire to rivers of black ice. down below, lady melisandre would be lighting her nightfire and chanting, lord of light, defend us, for the night is dark and full of terrors. winter is coming, jon said at last, breaking the awkward silence, and with it the white walkers. the wall is where we stop them. the wall was made to stop them ... but the wall must be manned. this discussion is at an end. we have much to do before the gate is opened. tormund and his people will need to be fed and clothed and housed. some are sick and will need nursing. those will fall to you, clydas. save as many as you can. clydas blinked his dim pink eyes. i will do my best, jon. my lord, i mean. we will need every cart and wagon made ready to transport the free folk to their new homes. othell, you shall see to that. yarwyck grimaced. aye, lord commander. lord bowen, you shall collect the tolls. the gold and silver, the amber, the torques and armbands and necklaces. sort it all, count it, see that it reaches eastwatch safely. yes, lord snow, said bowen marsh. and jon thought, ice, she said, and daggers in the dark. blood frozen red and hard, and naked steel. his sword hand flexed. the wind was rising. that night he dreamt of wildlings howling from the woods, advancing to the moan of warhorns and the roll of drums. boom doom boom doom boom doom came the sound, a thousand hearts with a single beat. some had spears and some had bows and some had axes. others rode on chariots made of bones, drawn by teams of dogs as big as ponies. giants lumbered amongst them, forty feet tall, with mauls the size of oak trees. stand fast, jon snow called. throw them back. he stood atop the wall, alone. flame, he cried, feed them flame, but there was no one to pay heed. they are all gone. they have abandoned me. burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze. snow, an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. as the dead men reached the top of the wall he sent them down to die again. he slew a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, a girl with thick red hair. too late he recognized ygritte. she was gone as quick as she'd appeared. the world dissolved into a red mist. jon stabbed and slashed and cut. he hacked down donal noye and gutted deaf dick follard. qhorin halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. i am the lord of winterfell, jon screamed. it was robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. longclaw took his head off. then a gnarled hand seized jon roughly by the shoulder. he whirled ... ... and woke with a raven pecking at his chest. snow, the bird cried. jon swatted at it. the raven shrieked its displeasure and flapped up to a bedpost to glare down balefully at him through the predawn gloom. the day had come. it was the hour of the wolf. soon enough the sun would rise, and four thousand wildlings would come pouring through the wall. madness. jon snow ran his burned hand through his hair and wondered once again what he was doing. once the gate was opened there would be no turning back. it should have been the old bear to treat with tormund. it should have been jaremy rykker or qhorin half hand or denys mallister or some other seasoned man. it should have been my uncle. it was too late for such misgivings, though. every choice had its risks, every choice its consequences. he would play the game to its conclusion. he rose and dressed in darkness, as mormont's raven muttered across the room. corn, the bird said, and, king, and, snow, jon snow, jon snow. that was queer. the bird had never said his full name before, as best jon could recall. he broke his fast in the cellar with his officers. fried bread, fried eggs, blood sausages, and barley porridge made up the meal, washed down with thin yellow beer. as they ate they went over the preparations yet again. all is in readiness, bowen marsh assured him. if the wildlings uphold the terms of the bargain, all will go as you've commanded. and if not, it may turn to blood and carnage. remember, jon said, tormund's people are hungry, cold, and fearful. some of them hate us as much as some of you hate them. we are dancing on rotten ice here, them and us. one crack, and we all drown. if blood should be shed today, it had best not be one of us who strikes the first blow, or i swear by the old gods and the new that i will have the head of the man who strikes it. they answered him with ayes and nods and muttered words, with as you command, and it will be done, and yes, my lord. and one by one they rose and buckled on their swords and donned their warm black cloaks and strode out into the cold. last to leave the table was dolorous edd tollett, who had come in during the night with six wagons from the long barrow. whore's barrow, the black brothers called the fortress now. edd had been sent to gather up as many spearwives as his wagons would hold and bring them back to join their sisters. jon watched him mop up a runny yolk with a chunk of bread. it was strangely comforting to see edd's dour face again. how goes the restoration work? he asked his old steward. ten more years should do it, tollett replied in his usual gloomy tone. place was overrun with rats when we moved in. the spearwives killed the nasty buggers. now the place is overrun with spearwives. there's days i want the rats back. how do you find serving under iron emmett? jon asked. mostly it's black maris serving under him, m'lord. me, i have the mules. nettles claims we're kin. it's true we have the same long face, but i'm not near as stubborn. anyway i never knew their mothers, on my honor. he finished the last of his eggs and sighed. i do like me a nice runny egg. if it please m'lord, don't let the wildlings eat all our chickens. out in the yard, the eastern sky had just begun to lighten. there was not a wisp of cloud in sight. we have a good day for this, it would seem, jon said. a bright day, warm and sunny. the wall will weep. and winter almost on us. it's unnatural, m'lord. a bad sign, you ask me. jon smiled. and if it were to snow? a worse sign. what sort of weather would you prefer? the sort they keep indoors, said dolorous edd. if it please m'lord, i should get back to my mules. they miss me when i'm gone. more than i can say for them spearwives. they parted there, tollett for the east road, where his wagons waited, jon snow for the stables. satin had his horse saddled and bridled and waiting for him, a fiery grey courser with a mane as black and shiny as maester's ink. he was not the sort of mount that jon would have chosen for a ranging, but on this morning all that mattered was that he look impressive, and for that the stallion was a perfect choice. his tail was waiting too. jon had never liked surrounding himself with guards, but today it seemed prudent to keep a few good men beside him. they made a grim display in their ringmail, iron halfhelms, and black cloaks, with tall spears in their hands and swords and daggers on their belts. for this jon had passed over all the green boys and greybeards in his command, choosing eight men in their prime: ty and mully, left hand lew, big liddle, rory, fulkthe flea, garrett greenspear. and leathers, castle black's new master-at-arms, to show the free folk that even a man who had fought for mance in the battle beneath the wall could find a place of honor in the night's watch. a deep red blush had appeared in the east by the time they all assembled at the gate. the stars are going out, jon thought. when next they reappeared, they would be shining down upon a world forever changed. a few queen's men stood watching from beside the embers of lady melisandre's nightfire. when jon glanced at the king's tower, he glimpsed a flash of red behind a window. of queen selyse he saw no sign. it was time. open the gate, jon snow said softly. open the gate! big liddle roared. his voice was thunder. seven hundred feet above, the sentries heard and raised their warhorns to their lips. the sound rang out, echoing off the wall and out across the world. ahoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. one long blast. for a thousand years or more, that sound had meant rangers coming home. today it meant something else. today it called the free folk to their new homes. on either end of the long tunnel, gates swung open and iron bars unlocked. dawn light shimmered on the ice above, pink and gold and purple. dolorous edd had not been wrong. the wall would soon be weeping. gods grant it weeps alone. satin led them underneath the ice, lighting the way through the gloom of the tunnel with an iron lantern. jon followed, leading his horse. then his guardsmen. after them came bowen marsh and his stewards, a score of them, every man assigned a task. above, ulmer of the kingswood had the wall. two score of castle black's best bowmen stood with him, ready to respond to any trouble down below with a rain of arrows. north of the wall, tormund giantsbane was waiting, mounted on a runty little garron that looked far too weedy to support his weight. his two remaining sons were with him, tall toregg and young dryn, along with three score warriors. har! tormund called. guards, is it? now where's the trust in that, crow? you brought more men than i did. so i did. come here by me, lad. i want my folk to see you. i got thousands ne'er saw a lord commander, grown men who were told as boys that your rangers would eat them if they didn't behave. they need to see you plain, a long-faced lad in an old black cloak. they need to learn that the night's watch is naught t'be feared. that is a lesson i would sooner they never learned. jon peeled the glove off his burned hand, put two fingers in his mouth, and whistled. ghost came racing from the gate. tormund's horse shied so hard that the wild-ling almost lost his saddle. naught to be feared? jon said. ghost, stay. you are a black-hearted bastard, lord crow. tormund horn-blower lifted his own warhorn to his lips. the sound of it echoed off the ice like rolling thunder, and the first of the free folk began to stream toward the gate. from dawn till dusk jon watched the wildlings pass. the hostages went first— one hundred boys between the ages of eight and sixteen. your blood price, lord crow, tormund declared. i hope the wailing o' their poor mothers don't haunt your dreams at night. some of the boys were led to the gate by a mother or a father, others by older siblings. more came alone. fourteenand fifteen-year-old boys were almost men, and did not want to be seen clinging to a woman's skirts. two stewards counted the boys as they went by, noting each name on long sheepskin scrolls. a third collected their valuables for the toll and wrote that down as well. the boys were going to a place that none had ever been before, to serve an order that had been the enemy of their kith and kin for thousands of years, yet jon saw no tears, heard no wailing mothers. these are winter's people, he reminded himself. tears freeze upon your cheeks where they come from. not a single hostage balked or tried to slink away when his turn came to enter that gloomy tunnel. almost all the boys were thin, some past the point of gauntness, with spindly shanks and arms like twigs. that was no more than jon expected. elsewise they came in every shape and size and color. he saw tall boys and short boys, brown-haired boys and black-haired boys, honey blonds and strawberry blonds and redheads kissed by fire, like ygritte. he saw boys with scars, boys with limps, boys with pockmarked faces. many of the older boys had downy cheeks or wispy little mustachios, but there was one fellow with a beard as thick as tormund's. some dressed in fine soft furs, some in boiled leather and oddments of armor, more in wool and seal-skins, a few in rags. one was naked. many had weapons: sharpened spears, stone-headed mauls, knives made of bone or stone or dragonglass, spiked clubs, tanglenets, even here and there a rust-eaten old sword. the hornfoot boys walked blithe and barefoot through the snowdrifts. other lads had bear-paws on their boots and walked on top of the same drifts, never sinking through the crust. six boys arrived on horses, two on mules. a pair of brothers turned up with a goat. the biggest hostage was six-and-a-half feet tall but had a baby's face; the smallest was a runty boy who claimed nine years but looked no more than six. of special note were the sons of men of renown. tormund took care to point them out as they went by. the boy there is the son of soren shieldbreaker, he said of one tall lad. him with the red hair, he's gerrick kingsblood's get. comes o' the line o' raymun redbeard, to hear him tell it. the line o' redbeard's little brother, you want it true. two boys looked enough alike to be twins, but tormund insisted they were cousins, born a year apart. one was sired by harle the huntsman, t'other by harle the handsome, both on the same woman. fathers hate each other. i was you, i'd send one to eastwatch and t'other to your shadow tower. other hostages were named as sons of howd wanderer, of brogg, of devyn sealskinner, kyleg of the wooden ear, morna white mask, the great walrus ... the great walrus? truly? they have queer names along the frozen shore. three hostages were sons of alfyn crowkiller, an infamous raider slain by qhorin halfhand. or so tormund insisted. they do not look like brothers, jon observed. half-brothers, born o' different mothers. alfyn's member was a wee thing, even smaller than yours, but he was never shy with where he stuck it. had a son in every village, that one. of a certain runty rat-faced boy, tormund said, that one's a whelp of varamyr sixskins. you remember varamyr, lord crow? he did. the skinchanger. aye, he was that. a vicious little runt besides. dead now, like as not. no one's seen him since the battle. two of the boys were girls in disguise. when jon saw them, he dispatched rory and big liddleto bring them to him. one came meekly enough, the other kicking and biting. this could end badly. do these two have famous fathers? har! them skinny things? not likely. picked by lot. they're girls. are they? tormund squinted at the pair of them from his saddle. me and lord crow made a wager on which o' you has the biggest member. pull them breeches down, give us a look. one of the girls turned red. the other glared defiantly. you leave us alone, tormund giantstink. you let us go. har! you win, crow. not a cock between 'em. the little one's got her a set o' balls, though. a spearwife in the making, her. he called to his own men. go find them something girly to put on before lord snow wets his smallclothes. i'll need two boys to take their places. how's that? tormund scratched his beard. a hostage is a hostage, seems to me. that big sharp sword o' yours can snick a girl's head off as easy as a boy's. a father loves his daughters too. well, most fathers. it is not their fathers who concern me. did mance ever sing of brave danny flint? not as i recall. who was he? a girl who dressed up like a boy to take the black. her song is sad and pretty. what happened to her wasn't. in some versions of the song, her ghost still walked the nightfort. i'll send the girls to long barrow. the only men there were iron emmett and dolorous edd, both of whom he trusted. that was not something he could say of all his brothers. the wildling understood. nasty birds, you crows. he spat. two more boys, then. you'll have them. when nine-and-ninety hostages had shuffled by them to pass beneath the wall, tormund giantsbane produced the last one. my son dryn. you'll see he's well taken care of, crow, or i'll cook your black liver up and eat it. jon gave the boy a close inspection. bran's age, or the age he would have been if theon had not killed him. dryn had none of bran's sweetness, though. he was a chunky boy, with short legs, thick arms, and a wide red face— a miniature version of his father, with a shock of dark brown hair. he'll serve as my own page, jon promised tormund. hear that, dryn? see that you don't get above yourself. to jon he said, he'll need a good beating from time to time. be careful o' his teeth, though. he bites. he reached down for his horn again, raised it, and blew another blast. this time it was warriors who came forward. and not just one hundred of them. five hundred, jon snow judged, as they moved out from beneath the trees, perhaps as many as a thousand. one in every ten of them came mounted but all of them came armed. across their backs they bore round wicker shields covered with hides and boiled leather, displaying painted images of snakes and spiders, severed heads, bloody hammers, broken skulls, and demons. a few were clad in stolen steel, dinted oddments of armor looted from the corpses of fallen rangers. others had armored themselves in bones, like rattleshirt. all wore fur and leather. there were spearwives with them, long hair streaming. jon could not look at them without remembering ygritte: the gleam of fire in her hair, the look on her face when she'd disrobed for him in the grotto, the sound of her voice. you know nothing, jon snow, she'd told him a hundred times. it is as true now as it was then. you might have sent the women first, he said to tormund. the mothers and the maids. the wildling gave him a shrewd look. aye, i might have. and you crows might decide to close that gate. a few fighters on t'other side, well, that way the gate stays open, don't it? he grinned. i bought your bloody horse, jon snow. don't mean that we can't count his teeth. now don't you go thinking me and mine don't trust you. we trust you just as much as you trust us. he snorted. you wanted warriors, didn't you? well, there they are. every one worth six o' your black crows. jon had to smile. so long as they save those weapons for our common foe, i am content. gave you my word on it, didn't i? the word of tormund giantsbane. strong as iron, 'tis. he turned and spat. amongst the stream of warriors were the fathers of many of jon's hostages. some stared with cold dead eyes as they went by, fingering their sword hilts. others smiled at him like long-lost kin, though a few of those smiles discomfited jon snow more than any glare. none knelt, but many gave him their oaths. what tormund swore, i swear, declared black-haired brogg, a man of few words. soren shieldbreaker bowed his head an inch and growled, soren's axe is yours, jon snow, if ever you have need of such. red-bearded gerrick kingsblood brought three daughters. they will make fine wives, and give their husbands strong sons of royal blood, he boasted. like their father, they are descended from raymun redbeard, who was king-beyond-the-wall. blood meant little and less amongst the free folk, jon knew. ygritte had taught him that. gerrick's daughters shared her same flame-red hair, though hers had been a tangle of curls and theirs hung long and straight. kissed by fire. three princesses, each lovelier than the last, he told their father. i will see that they are presented to the queen. selyse baratheon would take to these three better than she had to val, he suspected; they were younger and considerably more cowed. sweet enough to look at them, though their father seems a fool. howd wanderer swore his oath upon his sword, as nicked and pitted a piece of iron as jon had ever seen. devyn sealskinner presented him with a sealskin hat, harle the huntsman with a bear-claw necklace. the warrior witch morna removed her weirwood mask just long enough to kiss his gloved hand and swear to be his man or his woman, whichever he preferred. and on and on and on. as they passed, each warrior stripped off his treasures and tossed them into one of the carts that the stewards had placed before the gate. amber pendants, golden torques, jeweled daggers, silver brooches set with gem-stones, bracelets, rings, niello cups and golden goblets, warhorns and drinking horns, a green jade comb, a necklace of freshwater pearls ... all yielded up and noted down by bowen marsh. one man surrendered a shirt of silver scales that had surely been made for some great lord. another produced a broken sword with three sapphires in the hilt. and there were queerer things: a toy mammoth made of actual mammoth hair, an ivory phallus, a helm made from a unicorn's head, complete with horn. how much food such things would buy in the free cities, jon snow could not begin to say. after the riders came the men of the frozen shore. jon watched a dozen of their big bone chariots roll past him one by one, clattering like rattleshirt. half still rolled as before; others had replaced their wheels with runners. they slid across the snowdrifts smoothly, where the wheeled chariots were foundering and sinking. the dogs that drew the chariots were fearsome beasts, as big as direwolves. their women were clad in sealskins, some with infants at their breasts. older children shuffled along behind their mothers and looked up at jon with eyes as dark and hard as the stones they clutched. some of the men wore antlers on their hats, and some wore walrus tusks. the two sorts did not love each other, he soon gathered. a few thin reindeer brought up the rear, with the great dogs snapping at the heels of stragglers. be wary o' that lot, jon snow, tormund warned him. a savage folk. the men are bad, the women worse. he took a skin off his saddle and offered it up to jon. here. this will make them seem less fearsome, might be. and warm you for the night. no, go on, it's yours to keep. drink deep. within was a mead so potent it made jon's eyes water and sent tendrils of fire snaking through his chest. he drank deep. you're a good man, tormund giantsbabe. for a wildling. better than most, might be. not so good as some. on and on the wildlings came, as the sun crept across the bright blue sky. just before midday, the movement stopped when an oxcart became jammed at a turn inside the tunnel. jon snow went to have a look for himself. the cart was now wedged solid. the men behind were threatening to hack it apart and butcher the ox where he stood, whilst the driver and his kin swore to kill them if they tried. with the help of tormund and his son toregg, jon managed to keep the wildlings from coming to blood, but it took the best part of an hour before the way was opened again. you need a bigger gate, tormund complained to jon with a sour look up at the sky, where a few clouds had blown in. too bloody slow this way. like sucking the milkwater through a reed. har. would that i had the horn of joramun. i'd give it a nice toot and we'd climb through the rubble. melisandre burned the horn of joramun. did she? tormund slapped his thigh and hooted. she burned that fine big horn, aye. a bloody sin, i call it. a thousand years old, that was. we found it in a giant's grave, and no man o' us had ever seen a horn so big. that must have been why mance got the notion to tell you it were joramun's. he wanted you crows to think he had it in his power to blow your bloody wall down about your knees. but we never found the true horn, not for all our digging. if we had, every kneeler in your seven kingdoms would have chunks o' ice to cool his wine all summer. jon turned in his saddle, frowning. andjoramun blew the horn of winter and woke giants from the earth. that huge horn with its bands of old gold, incised with ancient runes ... had mance rayder lied to him, or was tormund lying now? ifmance's horn was just a feint, where is the true horn? by afternoon the sun had gone, and the day turned grey and gusty. a snow sky, tormund announced grimly. others had seen the same omen in those flat white clouds. it seemed to spur them on to haste. tempers began to fray. one man was stabbed when he tried to slip in ahead of others who had been hours in the column. toregg wrenched the knife away from his attacker, dragged both men from the press, and sent them back to the wildling camp to start again. tormund, jon said, as they watched four old women pull a cartful of children toward the gate, tell me of our foe. i would know all there is to know of the others. the wildling rubbed his mouth. not here, he mumbled, not this side o' your wall. the old man glanced uneasily toward the trees in their white mantles. they're never far, you know. they won't come out by day, not when that old sun's shining, but don't think that means they went away. shadows never go away. might be you don't see them, but they're always clinging to your heels. did they trouble you on your way south? they never came in force, if that's your meaning, but they were with us all the same, nibbling at our edges. we lost more outriders than i care to think about, and it was worth your life to fall behind or wander off. every nightfall we'd ring our camps with fire. they don't like fire much, and no mistake. when the snows came, though ... snow and sleet and freezing rain, it's bloody hard to find dry wood or get your kindling lit, and the cold ... some nights our fires just seemed to shrivel up and die. nights like that, you always find some dead come the morning. 'less they find you first. the night that torwynd ... my boy, he ... tormund turned his face away. i know, said jon snow. tormund turned back. you know nothing. you killed a dead man, aye, i heard. mance killed a hundred. a man can fight the dead, but when their masters come, when the white mists rise up ... how do you fight a mist, crow? shadows with teeth ... air so cold it hurts to breathe, like a knife inside your chest ... you do not know, you cannot know ... can your sword cut cold? we will see, jon thought, remembering the things that sam had told him, the things he'd found in his old books. longclaw had been forged in the fires of old valyria, forged in dragonflame and set with spells. dragon-steel, sam called it. stronger than any common steel, lighter, harder, sharper ... but words in a book were one thing. the true test came in battle. you are not wrong, jon said. i do not know. and if the gods are good, i never will. the gods are seldom good, jon snow. tormund nodded toward the sky. the clouds roll in. already it grows darker, colder. your wall no longer weeps. look. he turned and called out to his son toregg. ride back to the camp and get them moving. the sick ones and the weak ones, the slugabeds and cravens, get them on their bloody feet. set their bloody tents afire if you must. the gate must close at nightfall. any man not through the wall by then had best pray the others get to him afore i do. you hear? i hear. toregg put his heels into his horse and galloped back down the column. on and on the wildlings came. the day grew darker, just as tormund said. clouds covered the sky from horizon to horizon, and warmth fled. there was more shoving at the gate, as men and goats and bullocks jostled each other out of the way. it is more than impatience, jon realized. they are afraid. warriors, spearwives, raiders, they are frightened of those woods, of shadows moving through the trees. they want to put the wall between them before the night descends. a snowflake danced upon the air. then another. dance with me, jon snow, he thought. you'll dance with me anon. on and on and on the wildlings came. some were moving faster now, hastening across the battleground. others— the old, the young, the feeble— could scarce move at all. this morning the field had been covered with a thick blanket of old snow, its white crust shining in the sun. now the field was brown and black and slimy. the passage of the free folk had turned the ground to mud and muck: wooden wheels and horses' hooves, runners of bone and horn and iron, pig trotters, heavy boots, the cloven feet of cows and bullocks, the bare black feet of the hornfoot folk, all had left their marks. the soft footing slowed the column even more. you need a bigger gate, tormund complained again. by late afternoon the snow was falling steadily, but the river of wildlings had dwindled to a stream. columns of smoke rose from the trees where their camp had been. toregg, tormund explained. burning the dead. always some who go to sleep and don't wake up. you find them in their tents, them as have tents, curled up and froze. toregg knows what to do. the stream was no more than a trickle by the time toregg emerged from the wood. with him rode a dozen mounted warriors armed with spears and swords. my rear guard, tormund said, with a gap-toothed smile. you crows have rangers. so do we. them i left in camp in case we were attacked before we all got out. your best men. or my worst. every man o' them has killed a crow. amongst the riders came one man afoot, with some big beast trotting at his heels. a boar, jon saw. a monstrous boar. twice the size of ghost, the creature was covered with coarse black hair, with tusks as long as a man's arm. jon had never seen a boar so huge or ugly. the man beside him was no beauty either; hulking, black-browed, he had a flat nose, heavy jowls dark with stubble, small black close-set eyes. borroq. tormund turned his head and spat. a skinchanger. it was not a question. somehow he knew. ghost turned his head. the falling snow had masked the boar's scent, but now the white wolf had the smell. he padded out in front of jon, his teeth bared in a silent snarl. no! jon snapped. ghost, down. stay. stay! boars and wolves, said tormund. best keep that beast o' yours locked up tonight. i'll see that borroq does the same with his pig. he glanced up at the darkening sky. them's the last, and none too soon. it's going to snow all night, i feel it. time i had a look at what's on t'other side of all that ice. you go ahead, jon told him. i mean to be the last one through the ice. i will join you at the feast. feast? har! now that's a word i like to hear. the wildling turned his garron toward the wall and slapped her on the rump. toregg and the riders followed, dismounting by the gate to lead their horses through. bowen marsh stayed long enough to supervise as his stewards pulled the last carts into the tunnel. only jon snow and his guards were left. the skinchanger stopped ten yards away. his monster pawed at the mud, snuffling. a light powdering of snow covered the boar's humped black back. he gave a snort and lowered his head, and for half a heartbeat jon thought he was about to charge. to either side of him, his men lowered their spears. brother, borroq said. you'd best go on. we are about to close the gate. you do that, borroq said. you close it good and tight. they're coming, crow. he smiled as ugly a smile as jon had ever seen and made his way to the gate. the boar stalked after him. the falling snow covered up their tracks behind them. that's done, then, rory said when they were gone. no, thought jon snow, it has only just begun. bowen marsh was waiting for him south of the wall, with a tablet full of numbers. three thousand one hundred and nineteen wildlings passed through the gate today, the lord steward told him. sixty of your hostages were sent off to eastwatch and the shadow tower after they'd been fed. edd tollett took six wagons of women back to long barrow. the rest remain with us. not for long, jon promised him. tormund means to lead his own folk to oakenshield within a day or two. the rest will follow, as soon as we sort where to put them. as you say, lord snow. the words were stiff. the tone suggested that bowen marsh knew where he would put them. the castle jon returned to was far different from the one he'd left that morning. for as long as he had known it, castle black had been a place of silence and shadows, where a meagre company of men in black moved like ghosts amongst the ruins of a fortress that had once housed ten times their numbers. all that had changed. lights now shone through windows where jon snow had never seen lights shine before. strange voices echoed down the yards, and free folk were coming and going along icy paths that had only known the black boots of crows for years. outside the old flint barracks, he came across a dozen men pelting one another with snow. playing, jon thought in astonishment, grown men playing like children, throwing snowballs the way bran andarya once did, and robb and me before them. donal noye's old armory was still dark and silent, however, and jon's rooms back of the cold forge were darker still. but he had no sooner taken off his cloak than dannel poked his head through the door to announce that clydas had brought a message. send him in. jon lit a taper from an ember in his brazier and three candles from the taper. clydas entered pink and blinking, the parchment clutched in one soft hand. beg pardon, lord commander. i know you must be weary, but i thought you would want to see this at once. you did well. jon read: at hardhome, with six ships. wild seas. blackbird lost with all hands, two lyseni ships driven aground on skane, talon taking water. very bad here. wildlings eating their own dead. dead things in the woods. braavosi captains will only take women, children on their ships. witch women call us slavers. attempt to take storm crow defeated, six crew dead, many wildlings. eight ravens left. dead things in the water. send help by land, seas wracked by storms. from talon, by hand of maester harmune. cotter pyke had made his angry mark below. is it grievous, my lord? asked clydas. grievous enough. dead things in the wood. dead things in the water. six ships left, of the eleven that set sail. jon snow rolled up the parchment, frowning. nightfalls, he thought, and now my war begins. let them die, said queen selyse. it was the answer that jon snow had expected. this gueen never fails to disappoint. somehow that did not soften the blow. your grace, he persisted stubbornly, they are starving at hardhome by the thousands. many are women—  —and children, yes. very sad. the queen pulled her daughter closer to her and kissed her cheek. the cheek unmarred by greyscale, jon did not fail to note. we are sorry for the little ones, of course, but we must be sensible. we have no food for them, and they are too young to help the king my husband in his wars. better that they be reborn into the light. that was just a softer way of saying let them die. the chamber was crowded. princess shireen stood beside her mother's seat, with patchface cross-legged at her feet. behind the queen loomed ser axell florent. melisandre of asshai stood closer to the fire, the ruby at her throat pulsing with every breath she took. the red woman too had her attendants— the squire devan seaworth and two of the guardsmen the king had left her. queen selyse's protectors stood along the walls, shining knights all in a row: ser malegorn, ser benethon, ser narbert, ser patrek, ser dorden, ser brus. with so many bloodthirsty wildlings infesting castle black, selyse kept her sworn shields about her night and day. tormund giants-bane had roared to hear it. afraid of being carried off, is she? i hope you never said how big me member is, jon snow, that'd frighten any woman. i always wanted me one with a mustache. then he laughed and laughed. he would not be laughing now. jon had wasted enough time here. i'm sorry to have troubled your grace. the night's watch will attend to this matter. the queen's nostrils flared. you still mean to ride to hardhome. i see it on your face. let them die, i said, yet you will persist in this mad folly. do not deny it. i must do as i think best. with respect, your grace, the wall is mine, and so is this decision. it is, selyse allowed, and you will answer for it when the king returns. and for other decisions you have made, i fear. but i see that you are deaf to sense. do what you must. up spoke ser malegorn. lord snow, who will lead this ranging? are you offering yourself, ser? do i look so foolish? patchface jumped up. i will lead it! his bells rang merrily. we will march into the sea and out again. under the waves we will ride seahorses, and mermaids will blow seashells to announce our coming, oh, oh, oh. they all laughed. even queen selyse allowed herself a thin smile. jon was less amused. i will not ask my men to do what i would not do myself. i mean to lead the ranging. how bold of you, said the queen. we approve. afterward some bard will make a stirring song about you, no doubt, and we shall have a more prudent lord commander. she took a sip of wine. let us speak of other matters. axell, bring in the wildling king, if you would be so good. at once, your grace. ser axell went through a door and returned a moment later with gerrick kingsblood. gerrick of house redbeard, he announced, king of the wildlings. gerrick kingsblood was a tall man, long of leg and broad of shoulder. the queen had dressed him in some of the king's old clothes, it appeared. scrubbed and groomed, clad in green velvets and an ermine half-cape, with his long red hair freshly washed and his fiery beard shaped and trimmed, the wildling looked every inch a southron lord. he could walk into the throne room at king's landing, and no one would blink an eye, jon thought. gerrick is the true and rightful king of the wildlings, the queen said, descended in an unbroken male line from their great king raymun red-beard, whereas the usurper mance rayder was born of some common woman and fathered by one of your black brothers. no, jon might have said, gerrick is descended from a younger brother of raymun redbeard. to the free folk that counted about as much as being descended from raymun redbeard's horse. they know nothing, ygritte. and worse, they will not learn. gerrick has graciously agreed to give the hand of his eldest daughter to my beloved axell, to be united by the lord of light in holy wedlock, queen selyse said. his other girls shall wed at the same time— the second daughter with ser brus buckler and the youngest with ser malegorn of redpool. sers. jon inclined his head to the knights in question. may you find happiness with your betrothed. under the sea, men marry fishes. patchface did a little dance step, jingling his bells. they do, they do, they do. queen selyse sniffed again. four marriages can be made as simply as three. it is past time that this woman val was settled, lord snow. i have decided that she shall wed my good and leal knight, ser patrek of king's mountain. has val been told, your grace? asked jon. amongst the free folk, when a man desires a woman, he steals her, and thus proves his strength, his cunning, and his courage. the suitor risks a savage beating if he is caught by the woman's kin, and worse than that if she herself finds him unworthy. a savage custom, axell florent said. ser patrek only chuckled. no man has ever had cause to question my courage. no woman ever will. queen selyse pursed her lips. lord snow, as lady val is a stranger to our ways, please send her to me, that i might instruct her in the duties of a noble lady toward her lord husband. that will go splendidly, i know. jon wondered if the queen would be so eager to see val married to one of her own knights if she knew val's feelings about princess shireen. as you wish, he said, though if i might speak freely—  no, i think not. you may take your leave of us. jon snow bent his knee, bowed his head, withdrew. he took the steps two at a time, nodding to the queen's guards as he descended. her grace had posted men on every landing to keep her safe from murderous wildlings. halfway down, a voice called out from above him. jon snow. jon turned. lady melisandre. we must speak. must we? / think not. my lady, i have duties. it is those duties i would speak of. she made her way down, the hem of her scarlet skirts swishing over the steps. it almost seemed as if she floated. where is your direwolf? asleep in my chambers. her grace does not allow ghost in her presence. she claims he scares the princess. and so long as borroq and his boar are about, i dare not let him loose. the skinchanger was to accompany soren shieldbreaker to stonedoor once the wayns carrying the seal-skinner's clan to greenguard returned. until such time, borroq had taken up residence in one of the ancient tombs beside the castle lichyard. the company of men long dead seemed to suit him better than that of the living, and his boar seemed happy rooting amongst the graves, well away from other animals. that thing is the size of a bull, with tusks as long as swords. ghost would go after him if he were loose, and one or both of them would not survive the meeting. borroq is the least of your concerns. this ranging ... a word from you might have swayed the queen. selyse has the right of this, lord snow. let them die. you cannot save them. your ships are lost- six remain. more than half the fleet. your ships are lost. all of them. not a man shall return. i have seen that in my fires. your fires have been known to lie. i have made mistakes, i have admitted as much, but— a grey girl on a dying horse. daggers in the dark. a promised prince, born in smoke and salt. it seems to me that you make nothing but mis-takes, my lady. where is stannis? what of rattleshirt and his spearwives? where is my sister? all your questions shall be answered. look to the skies, lord snow. and when you have your answers, send to me. winter is almost upon us now. i am your only hope. a fool's hope. jon turned and left her. leathers was prowling the yard outside. toregg has returned, he reported when jon emerged. his father's settled his people at oakenshield and will be back this afternoon with eighty fighting men. what did the bearded queen have to say? her grace can provide no help. too busy plucking out her chin hairs, is she? leathers spat. makes no matter. tormund's men and ours will be enough. enough to get us there, perhaps. it was the journey back that concerned jon snow. coming home, they would be slowed by thousands of free folk, many sick and starved. a river of humanity moving slower than a river of ice. that would leave them vulnerable. dead things in the woods. dead things in the water. how many men are enough? he asked leathers. a hundred? two hundred? five hundred? a thousand? should i take more men, or fewer? a smaller ranging would reach hardhome sooner ... but what good were swords without food? mother mole and her people were already at the point of eating their own dead. to feed them, he would need to bring carts and wagons, and draft animals to haul them— horses, oxen, dogs. instead of flying through the wood, they would be condemned to crawl. there is still much to decide. spread the word. i want all the leading men in the shieldhall when the evening watch begins. tormund should be back by then. where can i find toregg? with the little monster, like as not. he's taken a liking to one o' them milkmaids, i hear. he has taken a liking to val. her sister was a queen, why not her? tormund had once thought to make himself the king-beyond-the-wall, before mance had bested him. toregg the tall might well be dreaming the same dream. better him than gerrick kingsblood. let them be, said jon. i can speak with toregg later. he glanced up past the king's tower. the wall was a dull white, the sky above it whiter. a snow sky. just pray we do not get another storm. outside the armory, mully and the flea stood shivering at guard. shouldn't you be inside, out of this wind? jon asked. that'd be sweet, m'lord, said fulk the flea, but your wolf's in no mood for company today. mully agreed. he tried to take a bite o' me, he did. ghost?' jon was shocked. unless your lordship has some other white wolf, aye. i never seen him like this, m'lord. all wild-like, i mean. he was not wrong, as jon discovered for himself when he slipped inside the doors. the big white direwolf would not lie still. he paced from one end of the armory to the other, past the cold forge and back again. easy, ghost, jon called. down. sit, ghost. down. yet when he made to touch him, the wolf bristled and bared his teeth. it's that bloody boar. even in here, ghost can smell his stink. mormont's raven seemed agitated too. snow, the bird kept screaming. snow, snow, snow. jon shooed him off, had satin start a fire, then sent him out after bowen marsh and othell yarwyck. bring a flagon of mulled wine as well. three cups, m'lord? six. mully and the flea look in need of something warm. so will you. when satin left, jon seated himself and had another look at the maps of the lands north of the wall. the fastest way to hardhome was along the coast ... from eastwatch. the woods were thinner near the sea, the terrain mostly flatlands, rolling hills, and salt marshes. and when the autumn storms came howling, the coast got sleet and hail and freezing rain rather than snow. the giants are at eastwatch, and leathers says that some will help. from castle black the way was more difficult, right through the heart of the haunted forest. if the snow is this deep at the wall, how much worse up there? marsh entered snuffling, yarwyck dour. another storm, the first builder announced. how are we to work in this? i need more builders. use the free folk, jon said. yarwyck shook his head. more trouble than they're worth, that lot. sloppy, careless, lazy ... some good woodworkers here and there, i'll not deny it, but hardly a mason amongst them, and nary a smith. strong backs, might be, but they won't do as they are told. and us with all these ruins to turn back into forts. can't be done, my lord. i tell you true. it can't be done. it will be done, said jon, or they will live in ruins. a lord needed men about him he could rely upon for honest counsel. marsh and yarwyck were no lickspittles, and that was to the good ... but they were seldom any help either. more and more, he found he knew what they would say before he asked them. especially when it concerned the free folk, where their disapproval went bone deep. when jon settled stonedoor on soren shieldbreaker, yarwyck complained that it was too isolated. how could they know what mischief soren might get up to, off in those hills? when he conferred oakenshield on tormund giantsbane and queensgate on morna white mask, marsh pointed out that castle black would now have foes on either side who could easily cut them off from the rest of the wall. as for borroq, othell yarwyck claimed the woods north of stonedoor were full of wild boars. who was to say the skinchanger would not make his own pig army? hoarfrost hill and rimegate still lacked garrisons, so jon had asked their views on which of the remaining wildling chiefs and war lords might be best suited to hold them. we have brogg, gavin the trader, the great walrus ... howd wanderer walks alone, tormund says, but there's still harle the huntsman, harle the handsome, blind doss ... ygon old-father commands a following, but most are his owns sons and grandsons. he has eighteen wives, half of them stolen on raids. which of these ... none, bowen marsh had said. i know all these men by their deeds. we should be fitting them for nooses, not giving them our castles. aye, othell yarwyck had agreed. bad and worse and worst makes a beggar's choice. my lord had as well present us with a pack of wolves and ask which we'd like to tear our throats out. it was the same again with hardhome. satin poured whilst jon told them of his audience with the queen. marsh listened attentively, ignoring the mulled wine, whilst yarwyck drank one cup and then another. but no sooner had jon finished than the lord steward said, her grace is wise. let them die. jon sat back. is that the only counsel you can offer, my lord? tormund is bringing eighty men. how many should we send? shall we call upon the giants? the spearwives at long barrow? if we have women with us, it may put mother mole's people at ease. send women, then. send giants. send suckling babes. is that what my lord wishes to hear? bowen marsh rubbed at the scar he had won at the bridge of skulls. send them all. the more we lose, the fewer mouths we'll have to feed. yarwyck was no more helpful. if the wildlings at hardhome need saving, let the wildlings here go save them. tormund knows the way to hard-home. to hear him talk, he can save them all himself with his huge member. this was pointless, jon thought. pointless, fruitless, hopeless. thank you for your counsel, my lords. satin helped them back into their cloaks. as they walked through the armory, ghost sniffed at them, his tail upraised and bristling. my brothers. the night's watch needed leaders with the wisdom of maester aemon, the learning of samwell tarly, the courage of qhorin halfhand, the stubborn strength of the old bear, the compassion of donal noye. what it had instead was them. the snow was falling heavily outside. wind's from the south, yarwyck observed. it's blowing the snow right up against the wall. see? he was right. the switchback stair was buried almost to the first landing, jon saw, and the wooden doors of the ice cells and storerooms had vanished behind a wall of white. how many men do we have in ice cells? he asked bowen marsh. four living men. two dead ones. the corpses. jon had almost forgotten them. he had hoped to learn something from the bodies they'd brought back from the weirwood grove, but the dead men had stubbornly remained dead. we need to dig those cells out. ten stewards and ten spades should do it, said marsh. usewunwuntoo. as you command. ten stewards and one giant made short work of the drifts, but even when the doors were clear again, jon was not satisfied. those cells will be buried again by morning. we'd best move the prisoners before they smother. karstark too, m'lord? asked fulk the flea. can't we just leave that one shivering till spring? would that we could. cregan karstark had taken to howling in the night of late, and throwing frozen feces at whoever came to feed him. that had not made him beloved of his guards. take him to the lord commander's tower. the undervault should hold him. though partly collapsed, the old bear's former seat would be warmer than the ice cells. its subcellars were largely intact. cregan kicked at the guards when they came through the door, twisted and shoved when they grabbed him, even tried to bite them. but the cold had weakened him, and jon's men were bigger, younger, and stronger. they hauled him out, still struggling, and dragged him through thigh-high snow to his new home. what would the lord commander like us to do with his corpses? asked marsh when the living men had been moved. leave them. if the storm entombed them, well and good. he would need to burn them eventually, no doubt, but for the nonce they were bound with iron chains inside their cells. that, and being dead, should suffice to hold them harmless. tormund giantsbane timed his arrival perfectly, thundering up with his warriors when all the shoveling was done. only fifty seemed to have turned up, not the eighty toregg promised leathers, but tormund was not called tall-talker for naught. the wildling arrived red-faced, shouting for a horn of ale and something hot to eat. he had ice in his beard and more crusting his mustache. someone had already told the thunderfist about gerrick kingsblood and his new style. king o' the wildlings? tormund roared. har! king o' my hairy butt crack, more like. he has a regal look to him, jon said. he has a little red cock to go with all that red hair, that's what he has. raymund redbeard and his sons died at long lake, thanks to your bloody starks and the drunken giant. not the little brother. ever wonder why they called him the red raven? tormund's mouth split in a gap-toothed grin. first to fly the battle, he was. 'twas a song about it, after. the singer had to find a rhyme for craven, so ... he wiped his nose. if your queen's knights want those girls o' his, they're welcome to them. girls, squawked mormont's raven. girls, girls. that set tormund to laughing all over again. now there's a bird with sense. how much do you want for him, snow? i gave you a son, the least you could do is give me the bloody bird. i would, said jon, but like as not you'd eat him. tormund roared at that as well. eat, the raven said darkly, flapping its black wings. corn? corn? corn? we need to talk about the ranging, said jon. i want us to be of one mind at the shieldhall, we must— he broke off when mully poked his nose inside the door, grim-faced, to announce that clydas had brought a letter. tell him to leave it with you. i will read it later. as you say, m'lord, only ... clydas don't look his proper self ... he's more white than pink, if you get my meaning ... and he's shaking. dark wings, dark words, muttered tormund. isn't that what you kneelers say? we say, bleed a cold but feast a fever too, jon told him. we say, never drink with dornishmen when the moon is full. we say a lot of things. mully added his two groats. my old grandmother always used to say, summer friends will melt away like summer snows, but winter friends are friends forever. i think that's sufficient wisdom for the moment, said jon snow. show clydas in if you would be so good. mully had not been wrong; the old steward was trembling, his face as pale as the snows outside. i am being foolish, lord commander, but ... this letter frightens me. see here? bastard, was the only word written outside the scroll. no lord snow or jon snow or lord commander. simply bastard. and the letter was sealed with a smear of hard pink wax. you were right to come at once, jon said. you were right to be afraid. he cracked the seal, flattened the parchment, and read. your false king is dead, bastard. he and all his host were smashed in seven days of battle. i have his magic sword. tell his red whore. your false king's friends are dead. their heads upon the walls of winterfell. come see them, bastard. your false king lied, and so did you. you told the world you burned the king-beyond-the-wall. instead you sent him to winterfell to steal my bride from me. i will have my bride back. if you want mance rayder back, come and get him. i have him in a cage for all the north to see, proof of your lies. the cage is cold, but i have made him a warm cloak from the skins of the six whores who came with him to winterfell. i want my bride back. i want the false king's gueen. i want his daughter and his red witch. i want his wild ling princess. i want his little prince, the wildling babe. and i want my reek. send them to me, bastard, and i will not trouble you or your black crows. keep them from me, and i will cut out your bastard's heart and eat it. it was signed, ramsay bolton, trueborn lord of winterfell. snow? said tormund giantsbane. you look like your father's bloody head just rolled out o' that paper. jon snow did not answer at once. mully, help clydas back to his chambers. the night is dark, and the paths will be slippery with snow. satin, go with them. he handed tormund giantsbane the letter. here, see for yourself. the wildling gave the letter a dubious look and handed it right back. feels nasty ... but tormund thunderfist had better things to do than learn to make papers talk at him. they never have any good to say, now do they? not often, jon snow admitted. dark wings, dark words. perhaps there was more truth to those wise old sayings than he'd known. it was sent by ramsay snow. i'll read you what he wrote. when he was done, tormund whistled. har. that's buggered, and no mistake. what was that about mance? has him in a cage, does he? how, when hundreds saw your red witch burn the man? that was rattleshirt, jon almost said. that was sorcery. a glamor, she called it. melisandre ... look to the skies, she said. he set the letter down. a raven in a storm. she saw this coming. when you have your answers, send to me. might be all a skin o' lies. tormund scratched under his beard. if i had me a nice goose quill and a pot o' maester's ink, i could write down that me member was long and thick as me arm, wouldn't make it so. he has lightbringer. he talks of heads upon the walls of winterfell. he knows about the spearwives and their number. he knows about mance rayder. no. there is truth in there. i won't say you're wrong. what do you mean to do, crow? jon flexed the fingers of his sword hand. the night's watch takes no part. he closed his fist and opened it again. what you propose is nothing less than treason. he thought of robb, with snowf lakes melting in his hair. kill the boy and let the man be born. he thought of bran, clambering up a tower wall, agile as a monkey. of rickon's breathless laughter. of sansa, brushing out lady's coat and singing to herself. you know nothing, jon snow. he thought of arya, her hair as tangled as a bird's nest. / made him a warm cloak from the skins of the six whores who came with him to winterfell ... i want my bride back ... i want my bride back ... i want my bride back ... i think we had best change the plan, jon snow said. they talked for the best part of two hours. horse and rory had replaced fulk and mully at the armory door with the change of watch. with me, jon told them, when the time came. ghost would have followed as well, but as the wolf came padding after them, jon grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and wrestled him back inside. borroq might be amongst those gathering at the shieldhall. the last thing he needed just now was his wolf savaging the skinchanger's boar. the shieldhall was one of the older parts of castle black, a long drafty feast hall of dark stone, its oaken rafters black with the smoke of centuries. back when the night's watch had been much larger, its walls had been hung with rows of brightly colored wooden shields. then as now, when a knight took the black, tradition decreed that he set aside his former arms and take up the plain black shield of the brotherhood. the shields thus discarded would hang in the shieldhall. hundreds of knights meant hundreds of shields. hawks and eagles, dragons and griffins, suns and stags, wolves and wyverns, manticores, bulls, trees and flowers, harps, spears, crabs and krakens, red lions and golden lions and chequy lions, owls, lambs, maids and mermen, stallions, stars, buckets and buckles, flayed men and hanged men and burning men, axes, longswords, turtles, unicorns, bears, quills, spiders and snakes and scorpions, and a hundred other heraldic charges had adorned the shieldhall walls, blazoned in more colors than any rainbow ever dreamed of. but when a knight died, his shield was taken down, that it might go with him to his pyre or his tomb, and over the years and centuries fewer and fewer knights had taken the black. a day came when it no longer made sense for the knights of castle black to dine apart. the shieldhall was abandoned. in the last hundred years, it had been used only infrequently. as a dining hall, it left much to be desired— it was dark, dirty, drafty, and hard to heat in winter, its cellars infested with rats, its massive wooden rafters worm-eaten and festooned with cobwebs. but it was large and long enough to seat two hundred, and half again that many if they crowded close. when jon and tormund entered, a sound went through the hall, like wasps stirring in a nest. the wildlings outnumbered the crows by five to one, judging by how little black he saw. fewer than a dozen shields remained, sad grey things with faded paint and long cracks in the wood. but fresh torches burned in the iron sconces along the walls, and jon had ordered benches and tables brought in. men with comfortable seats were more inclined to listen, maester aemon had once told him; standing men were more inclined to shout. at the top of the hall a sagging platform stood. jon mounted it, with tormund giantsbaneat his side, and raised his hands for quiet. the wasps only buzzed the louder. then tormund put his warhorn to his lips and blew a blast. the sound filled the hall, echoing off the rafters overhead. silence fell. i summoned you to make plans for the relief of hardhome, jon snow began. thousands of the free folk are gathered there, trapped and starving, and we have had reports of dead things in the wood. to his left he saw marsh and yarwyck. othell was surrounded by his builders, whilst bowen had wick whittlestick, left hand lew, and alf of runnymudd beside him. to his right, soren shieldbreaker sat with his arms crossed against his chest. farther back, jon saw gavin the trader and harle the handsome whispering together. ygon oldfather sat amongst his wives, howd wanderer alone. borroq leaned against a wall in a dark corner. mercifully, his boar was nowhere in evidence. the ships i sent to take off mother mole and her people have been wracked by storms. we must send what help we can by land or let them die. two of queen selyse's knights had come as well, jon saw. ser narbert and ser benethon stood near the door at the foot of the hall. but the rest of the queen's men were conspicuous in their absence. i had hoped to lead the ranging myself and bring back as many of the free folk as could survive the journey. a flash of red in the back of the hall caught jon's eye. lady melisandre had arrived. but now i find i cannot go to hardhome. the ranging will be led by tormund giantsbane, known to you all. i have promised him as many men as he requires. and where will you be, crow? borroq thundered. hiding here in castle black with your white dog? no. i ride south. then jon read them the letter ramsay snow had written. the shieldhall went mad. every man began to shout at once. they leapt to their feet, shaking fists. so much for the calming power of comfortable benches. swords were brandished, axes smashed against shields. jon snow looked to tormund. the giantsbane sounded his horn once more, twice as long and twice as loud as the first time. the night's watch takes no part in the wars of the seven kingdoms, jon reminded them when some semblance of quiet had returned. it is not for us to oppose the bastard of bolton, to avenge stannis baratheon, to defend his widow and his daughter. this creature who makes cloaks from the skins of women has sworn to cut my heart out, and i mean to make him answer for those words ... but i will not ask my brothers to forswear their vows. the night's watch will make for hardhome. i ride to winterfell alone, unless ... jon paused. ... is there any man here who will come stand with me? the roar was all he could have hoped for, the tumult so loud that the two old shields tumbled from the walls. soren shieldbreaker was on his feet, the wanderer as well. toregg the tall, brogg, harle the huntsman and harle the handsome both, ygon oldfather, blind doss, even the great walrus. / have my swords, thought jon snow, and we are coming for you. bastard. yarwyck and marsh were slipping out, he saw, and all their men behind them. it made no matter. he did not need them now. he did not want them. no man can ever say i made my brothers break their vows. if this is oathbreaking, the crime is mine and mine alone. then tormund was pounding him on the back, all gap-toothed grin from ear to ear. well spoken, crow. now bring out the mead! make them yours and get them drunk, that's how it's done. we'll make a wildling o' you yet, boy. har! i will send for ale, jon said, distracted. melisandre was gone, he realized, and so were the queen's knights. / should have gone to selyse first. she has the right to know her lord is dead. you must excuse me. i'll leave you to get them drunk. har! a task i'm well suited for, crow. on your way! horse and rory fell in beside jon as he left the shieldhall. / should talk with melisandre after i see the gueen, he thought. if she could see a raven in a storm, she can find ramsay snow for me. then he heard the shouting ... and a roar so loud it seemed to shake the wall. that come from hardin's tower, m'lord, horse reported. he might have said more, but the scream cut him off. val, was jon's first thought. but that was no woman's scream. that is a man in mortal agony. he broke into a run. horse and rory raced after him. is it wights? asked rory. jon wondered. could his corpses have escaped their chains? the screaming had stopped by the time they came to hardin's tower, but wun weg wun dar wun was still roaring. the giant was dangling a bloody corpse by one leg, the same way arya used to dangle her doll when she was small, swinging it like a morningstar when menaced by vegetables. arya never tore her dolls to pieces, though. the dead man's sword arm was yards away, the snow beneath it turning red. let him go, jon shouted. wun wun, let him go. wun wun did not hear or did not understand. the giant was bleeding himself, with sword cuts on his belly and his arm. he swung the dead knight against the grey stone of the tower, again and again and again, until the man's head was red and pulpy as a summer melon. the knight's cloak flapped in the cold air. of white wool it had been, bordered in cloth-of -silver and patterned with blue stars. blood and bone were flying everywhere. men poured from the surrounding keeps and towers. northmen, free folk, queen's men ... form a line, jon snow commanded them. keep them back. everyone, but especially the queen's men. the dead man was ser patrek of king's mountain; his head was largely gone, but his heraldry was as distinctive as his face. jon did not want to risk ser malegorn or ser brus or any of the queen's other knights trying to avenge him. wun weg wun dar wun howled again and gave ser patrek's other arm a twist and pull. it tore loose from his shoulder with a spray of bright red blood. like a child pulling petals off a daisy, thought jon. leathers, talk to him, calm him. the old tongue, he understands the old tongue. keep back, the rest of you. put away your steel, we're scaring him. couldn't they see the giant had been cut? jon had to put an end to this or more men would die. they had no idea of wun wun's strength. a horn, i need a horn. he saw the glint of steel, turned toward it. no blades! he screamed. wick, put that knife ... ... away, he meant to say. when wick whittlestick slashed at his throat, the word turned into a grunt. jon twisted from the knife, just enough so it barely grazed his skin. he cut me. when he put his hand to the side of his neck, blood welled between his fingers. why? for the watch. wick slashed at him again. this time jon caught his wrist and bent his arm back until he dropped the dagger. the gangling steward backed away, his hands upraised as if to say, not me, it was not me. men were screaming. jon reached for longclaw, but his fingers had grown stiff and clumsy. somehow he could not seem to get the sword free of its scabbard. then bowen marsh stood there before him, tears running down his cheeks. for the watch. he punched jon in the belly. when he pulled his hand away, the dagger stayed where he had buried it. jon fell to his knees. he found the dagger's hilt and wrenched it free. in the cold night air the wound was smoking. ghost, he whispered. pain washed over him. stick them with the pointy end. when the third dagger took him between the shoulder blades, he gave a grunt and fell face-first into the snow. he never felt the fourth knife. only the cold ... the queen's hand the dornish prince was three days dying. he took his last shuddering breath in the bleak black dawn, as cold rain hissed from a dark sky to turn the brick streets of the old city into rivers. the rain had drowned the worst of the fires, but wisps of smoke still rose from the smoldering ruin that had been the pyramid of hazkar, and the great black pyramid of yherizan where rhaegal had made his lair hulked in the gloom like a fat woman bedecked with glowing orange jewels. perhaps the gods are not deaf after all, ser barristan selmy reflected as he watched those distant embers. if not for the rain, the fires might have consumed all ofmeereen by now. he saw no sign of dragons, but he had not expected to. the dragons did not like the rain. a thin red slash marked the eastern horizon where the sun might soon appear. it reminded selmy of the first blood welling from a wound. often, even with a deep cut, the blood came before the pain. he stood beside the parapets of the highest step of the great pyramid, searching the sky as he did every morning, knowing that the dawn must come and hoping that his queen would come with it. she will not have abandoned us, she would never leave her people, he was telling himself, when he heard the prince's death rattle coming from the queen's apartments. ser barristan went inside. rainwater ran down the back of his white cloak, and his boots left wet tracks on the floors and carpets. at his command, quentyn martell had been laid out in the queen's own bed. he had been a knight, and a prince of dome besides. it seemed only kind to let him die in the bed he had crossed half a world to reach. the bedding was ruined— sheets, covers, pillows, mattress, all reeked of blood and smoke, but ser barristan thought daenerys would forgive him. missandei sat at the bedside. she had been with the prince night and day, tending to such needs as he could express, giving him water and milk of the poppy when he was strong enough to drink, listening to the few tortured words he gasped out from time to time, reading to him when he fell quiet, sleeping in her chair beside him. ser barristan had asked some of the queen's cupbearers to help, but the sight of the burned man was too much for even the boldest of them. and the blue graces had never come, though he'd sent for them four times. perhaps the last of them had been carried off by the pale mare by now. the tiny naathi scribe looked up at his approach. honored ser. the prince is beyond pain now. his dornish gods have taken him home. see? he smiles. how can you tell? he has no lips. it would have been kinder if the dragons had devoured him. that at least would have been quick. this ... fire is a hideous way to die. small wonder half the hells are made of flame. cover him. missandei pulled the coverlet over the prince's face. what will be done with him, ser? he is so very far from home. i'll see that he's returned to dome. but how? as ashes? that would require more fire, and ser barristan could not stomach that. we'll need to strip the flesh from his bones. beetles, not boiling. the silent sisters would have seen to it at home, but this was slaver's bay. the nearest silent sister was ten thousand leagues away. you should go sleep now, child. in your own bed. if this one may be so bold, ser, you should do the same. you do not sleep the whole night through. not for many years, child. not since the trident. grand maester pycelle had once told him that old men do not need as much sleep as the young, but it was more than that. he had reached that age when he was loath to close his eyes, for fear that he might never open them again. other men might wish to die in bed asleep, but that was no death for a knight of the kingsguard. the nights are too long, he told missandei, and there is much and more to do, always. here, as in the seven kingdoms. but you have done enough for now, child. go and rest. and if the gods are good, you will not dream of dragons. after the girl was gone, the old knight peeled back the coverlet for one last look at quentyn martell'sface, or what remained of it. so much of the prince's flesh had sloughed away that he could see the skull beneath. his eyes were pools of pus. he should have stayed in dome. he should have stayed a frog. not all men are meant to dance with dragons. as he covered the boy once more, he found himself wondering whether there would be anyone to cover his queen, or whether her own corpse would lie un-mourned amongst the tall grasses of the dothraki sea, staring blindly at the sky until her flesh fell from her bones. no, he said aloud. daenerys is not dead. she was riding that dragon. i saw it with mine own two eyes. he had said the same a hundred times before ... but every day that passed made it harder to believe. her hair was afire. i saw that too. she was burning ... and if i did not see her fall, hundreds swear they did. day had crept upon the city. though the rain still fell, a vague light suffused the eastern sky. and with the sun arrived the shavepate. skahaz was clad in his familiar garb of pleated black skirt, greaves, and muscled breastplate. the brazen mask beneath his arm was new— a wolf's head with lolling tongue. so, he said, by way of greeting, the fool is dead, is he? prince quentyn died just before first light. selmy was not surprised that skahaz knew. word traveled quickly within the pyramid. is the council assembled? they await the hand's pleasure below. / am no hand, a part of him wanted to cry out. / am only a simple knight, the queen's protector. i never wanted this. but with the queen gone and the king in chains, someone had to rule, and ser barristan did not trust the shavepate. has there been any word from the green grace? she is not yet returned to the city. skahaz had opposed sending the priestess. nor had galazza galare herself embraced the task. she would go, she allowed, for the sake of peace, but hizdahr zo loraq was better suited to treat with the wise masters. but ser barristan did not yield easily, and finally the green grace had bowed her head and sworn to do her best. how stands the city? selmy asked the shavepate now. all the gates are closed and barred, as you commanded. we are hunting down any sellswords or yunkai'i left inside the city and expelling or arresting those we catch. most seem to have gone to ground. inside the pyramids, beyond a doubt. the unsullied man the walls and towers, ready for any assault. there are two hundred highborn gathered in the square, standing in the rain in their tokars and howling for audience. they want hizdahr free and me dead, and they want you to slay these dragons. someone told them knights were good at that. men are still pulling corpses from the pyramid of hazkar. the great masters of yherizan and uhlez have abandoned their own pyramids to the dragons. ser barristan had known all that. and the butcher's tally? he asked, dreading the answer. nine-and-twenty.  nine-and-twenty? that was far worse than he could ever have imagined. the sons of the harpy had resumed their shadow war two days ago. three murders the first night, nine the second. but to go from nine to nine-and-twenty in a single night ... the count will pass thirty before midday. why do you look so grey, old man? what did you expect? the harpy wants hizdahr free, so he has sent his sons back into the streets with knives in hand. the dead are all freed-men and shavepates, as before. one was mine, a brazen beast. the sign of the harpy was left beside the bodies, chalked on the pavement or scratched into a wall. there were messages as well. 'dragons must die,' they wrote, and 'harghaz the hero.' 'death to daenerys' was seen as well, before the rain washed out the words. the blood tax ... twenty-nine hundred pieces of gold from each pyramid, aye, skahaz grumbled. it will be collected ... but the loss of a few coins will never stay the harpy's hand. only blood can do that. so you say. the hostages again. he would kill them every one if i allowed it. i heard you the first hundred times. no. queen's hand, skahaz grumbled with disgust. an old woman's hand, i am thinking, wrinkled and feeble. i pray daenerys returns to us soon. he pulled his brazen wolf's mask down over his face. your council will be growing restless. they are the queen's council, not mine. selmy exchanged his damp cloak for a dry one and buckled on his sword belt, then accompanied the shavepate down the steps. the pillared hall was empty of petitioners this morning. though he had assumed the title of hand, ser barristan would not presume to hold court in the queen's absence, nor would he permit skahaz mo kandaq to do such. hizdahr's grotesque dragon thrones had been removed at ser barristan's command, but he had not brought back the simple pillowed bench the queen had favored. instead a large round table had been set up in the center of the hall, with tall chairs all around it where men might sit and talk as peers. they rose when ser barristan came down the marble steps, skahaz shavepate at his side. marselen of the mother's men was present, with symon stripeback, commander of the free brothers. the stalwart shields had chosen a new commander, a black-skinned summer islander called tal toraq, their old captain, mollono yos dob, having been carried off by the pale mare. grey worm was there for the unsullied, attended by three eunuch serjeants in spiked bronze caps. the stormcrows were represented by two seasoned sellswords, an archer named jokin and the scarred and sour axeman known simply as the widower. the two of them had assumed joint command of the company in the absence of daario naharis. most of the queen's khalasar had gone with aggo and rakharo to search for her on the dothraki sea, but the squinty, bowlegged jaqqa rhan rommo was there to speak for the riders who remained. and across the table from ser barristan sat four of king hizdahr's erst -while guardsmen, the pit fighters goghor the giant, belaquo bonebreaker, camarron of the count, and the spotted cat. selmy had insisted on their presence, over the objections of skahaz shavepate. they had helped daenerys targaryen take this city once, and that should not be forgotten. blood-soaked brutes and killers they might be, but in their own way they had been loyal ... to king hizdahr, yes, but to the queen as well. last to come, strong belwas lumbered into the hall. the eunuch had looked death in the face, so near he might have kissed her on the lips. it had marked him. he looked to have lost two stone of weight, and the dark brown skin that had once stretched tight across a massive chest and belly, crossed by a hundred faded scars, now hung on him in loose folds, sagging and wobbling, like a robe cut three sizes too large. his step had slowed as well, and seemed a bit uncertain. even so, the sight of him gladdened the old knight's heart. he had once crossed the world with strong belwas, and he knew he could rely on him, should all this come to swords. belwas. we are pleased that you could join us. whitebeard. belwas smiled. where is liver and onions? strong belwas is not so strong as before, he must eat, get big again. they made strong belwas sick. someone must die. someone will. many someones, like as not. sit, my friend. when belwas sat and crossed his arms, ser barristan went on. quentyn martell died this morning, just before the dawn. the widower laughed. the dragonrider. fool, i call him, said symon stripeback. no, just a boy. ser barristan had not forgotten the follies of his own youth. speak no ill of the dead. the prince paid a ghastly price for what he did. and the other dornish? asked tal taraq. prisoners, for the nonce. neither of the dornishmen had offered any resistance. archibald yronwood had been cradling his prince's scorched and smoking body when the brazen beasts had found him, as his burned hands could testify. he had used them to beat out the flames that had engulfed quentyn martell. gerris drinkwater was standing over them with sword in hand, but he had dropped the blade the moment the locusts had appeared. they share a cell. let them share a gibbet, said symon stripeback. they unleashed two dragons on the city. open the pits and give them swords, urged the spotted cat. i will kill them both as all meereen shouts out my name. the fighting pits will remain closed, said selmy. blood and noise would only serve to call the dragons. all three, perhaps, suggested marselen. the black beast came once, why not again? this time with our queen. or without her. should drogon return to meereen without daenerys mounted on his back, the city would erupt in blood and flame, of that ser barristan had no doubt. the very men sitting at this table would soon be at dagger points with one another. a young girl she might be, but daenerys targaryen was the only thing that held them all together. her grace will return when she returns, said ser barristan. we have herded a thousand sheep into the daznak's pit, filled the pit of ghrazz with bullocks, and the golden pit with beasts that hizdahr zo loraq had gathered for his games. thus far both dragons seemed to have a taste for mutton, returning to daznak's whenever they grew hungry. if either one was hunting man, inside or outside the city, ser barristan had yet to hear of it. the only meereenese the dragons had slain since harghaz the hero had been the slav ers foolish enough to object when rhaegal attempted to make his lair atop the pyramid of hazkar. we have more pressing matters to discuss. i have sent the green grace to the yunkishmen to make arrangements for the release of our hostages. i expect her back by midday with their answer. with words/' said the widower. the stormcrows know the yunkai'i. their tongues are worms that wriggle this way or that. the green grace will come back with worm words, not the captain. if it pleases the queen's hand to recall, the wise masters hold our hero too, said grey worm. also the horselord jhogo, the queen's own blood rider. blood of her blood, agreed the dothraki rommo. he must be freed. the honor of the khalasar demands it. he shall be freed, said ser barristan, but first we must needs wait and see if the green grace can accomplish— skahaz shavepate slammed his fist upon the table. the green grace will accomplish nothing. she may be conspiring with the yunkai'i even as we sit here. arrangements, did you say? make arrangements? what sort of arrangements? ransom, said ser barristan. each man's weight in gold. the wise masters do not need our gold, ser, said marselen. they are richer than your westerosi lords, everyone. their sellswords will want the gold, though. what are the hostages to them? if the yunkishmen refuse, it will drive a blade between them and their hirelings. or so i hope. it had been missandei who suggested the ploy to him. he would never have thought of such a thing himself. in king's landing, bribes had been littlefinger's domain, whilst lord varys had the task of fostering division amongst the crown's enemies. his own duties had been more straightforward. eleven years of age, yet missandei is as clever as half the men at this table and wiser than all of them. i have instructed the green grace to present the offer only when all of the yunkish commanders have assembled to hear it. they will refuse, even so, insisted symon stripeback. they will say they want the dragons dead, the king restored. i pray that you are wrong. and fear that you are right. your gods are far away, ser grandfather, said the widower. i do not think they hear your prayers. and when the yunkai'i send back the old woman to spit in your eye, what then? fire and blood, said barristan selmy, softly, softly. for a long moment no one spoke. then strong belwas slapped his belly and said, better than liver and onions, and skahaz shavepate stared through the eyes of his wolf's head mask and said, you would break king hizdahr's peace, old man? i would shatter it. once, long ago, a prince had named him barristan the bold. a part of that boy was in him still. we have built a beacon atop the pyramid where once the harpy stood. dry wood soaked with oil, covered to keep the rain off. should the hour come, and i pray that it does not, we will light that beacon. the flames will be your signal to pour out of our gates and attack. every man of you will have a part to play, so every man must be in readiness at all times, day or night. we will destroy our foes or be destroyed ourselves. he raised a hand to signal to his waiting squires. i have had some maps prepared to show the dispositions of our foes, their camps and siege lines and trebuchets. if we can break the slavers, their sellswords will abandon them. i know you will have concerns and questions. voice them here. by the time we leave this table, all of us must be of a single mind, with a single purpose. best send down for some food and drink, then, suggested symon stripeback. this will take a while. it took the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon. the captains and commanders argued over the maps like fishwives over a bucket of crabs. weak points and strong points, how to best employ their small company of archers, whether the elephants should be used to break the yunkish lines or held in reserve, who should have the honor of leading the first advance, whether their horse cavalry was best deployed on the flanks or in the vanguard. ser barristan let each man speak his mind. tal toraq thought that they should march on yunkai once they had broken through the lines; the yellow city would be almost undefended, so the yunkai'i would have no choice but to lift the siege and follow. the spotted cat proposed to challenge the enemy to send forth a champion to face him in single combat. strong belwas liked that notion but insisted he should fight, not the cat. camarron of the count put forth a scheme to seize the ships tied up along the riverfront and use the skahazadhan to bring three hundred pit fighters around the yunkish rear. every man there agreed that the unsul-lied were their best troops, but none agreed on how they should be deployed. the widower wanted to use the eunuchs as an iron fist to smash through the heart of the yunkish defenses. marselen felt they would be better placed at either end of the main battle line, where they could beat back any attempt by the foe to turn their flanks. symon stripeback wanted them split into three and divided amongst the three companies of freed-men. his free brothers were brave and eager for the fight, he claimed, but without the unsullied to stiffen them he feared his unblooded troops might not have the discipline to face battle-seasoned sell swords by themselves. grey worm said only that the unsullied would obey, whatever might be asked of them. and when all that had been discussed, debated, and decided, symon stripeback raised one final point. as a slave in yunkai i helped my master bargain with the free companies and saw to the payment of their wages. i know sellswords, and i know that the yunkai'i cannot pay them near enough to face dragonflame. so i ask you ... if the peace should fail and this battle should be joined, will the dragons come? will they join the fight? they will come, ser barristan might have said. the noise will bring them, the shouts and screams, the scent of blood. that will draw them to the battlefield, just as the roar from daznak's pit drew drogon to the scarlet sands. but when they come, will they know one side from the other? somehow he did not think so. so he said only, the dragons will do what the dragons will do. if they do come, it may be that just the shadow of their wings will be enough to dishearten the slavers and send them fleeing. then he thanked them and dismissed them all. grey worm lingered after the others had left. these ones will be ready when the beacon fire is lit. but the hand must surely know that when we attack, the yunkai'i will kill the hostages. i will do all i can to prevent that, my friend. i have a ... notion. but pray excuse me. it is past time the dornishmen heard that their prince is dead. grey worm inclined his head. this one obeys. ser barristan took two of his new-made knights with him down into the dungeons. grief and guilt had been known to drive good men into madness, and archibald yronwood and gerris drinkwater had both played roles in their friend's demise. but when they reached the cell, he told turn and the red lamb to wait outside whilst he went in to tell the dornish that the prince's agony was over. ser archibald, the big bald one, had nothing to say. he sat on the edge of his pallet, staring down at his bandaged hands in their linen wrappings. ser gerris punched a wall. i told him it was folly. i begged him to go home. your bitch of a queen had no use for him, any man could see that. he crossed the world to offer her his love and fealty, and she laughed in his face. she never laughed, said selmy. if you knew her, you would know that. she spurned him. he offered her his heart, and she threw it back at him and went off to fuck her sellsword. you had best guard that tongue, ser. ser barristan did not like this gerris drinkwater, nor would he allow him to vilify daenerys. prince quentyn's death was his own doing, and yours. ours? how are we at fault, ser? quentyn was our friend, yes. a bit of a fool, you might say, but all dreamers are fools. but first and last he was our prince. we owed him our obedience. barristan selmy could not dispute the truth of that. he had spent the best part of his own life obeying the commands of drunkards and madmen. he came too late. he offered her his heart, ser gerris said again. she needed swords, not hearts. he would have given her the spears of dome as well. would that he had. no one had wanted daenerys to look with favor on the dornish prince more than barristan selmy. he came too late, though, and this folly ... buying sellswords, loosing two dragons on the city ... that was madness and worse than madness. that was treason. what he did he did for love of queen daenerys, gerris drinkwater insisted. to prove himself worthy of her hand. the old knight had heard enough. what prince quentyn did he did for dome. do you take me for some doting grandfather? i have spent my life around kings and queens and princes. sunspear means to take up arms against the iron throne. no, do not trouble to deny it. doran mar-tell is not a man to call his spears without hope of victory. duty brought prince quentyn here. duty, honor, thirst for glory ... never love. quentyn was here for dragons, not daenerys. you did not know him, ser. he— he's dead, drink. yronwood rose to his feet. words won't fetch him back. cletus and will are dead too. so shut your bloody mouth before i stick my fist in it. the big knight turned to selmy. what do you mean to do with us? skahaz shavepate wants you hanged. you slew four of his men. four of the queen's men. two were freedmen who had followed her grace since astapor. yronwood did not seem surprised. the beast men, aye. i only killed the one, the basilisk head. the sellswords did the others. don't matter, though, i know that. we were protecting quentyn, said drinkwater. we— be quiet, drink. he knows. to ser barristan the big knight said, no need to come and talk if you meant to hang us. so it's not that, is it? no. this one may not be as slow-witted as he seems. i have more use for you alive than dead. serve me, and afterward i will arrange a ship to take you back to dome and give you prince quentyn's bones to return to his lord father. ser archibald grimaced. why is it always ships? someone needs to take quent home, though. what do you ask of us, ser? your swords. you have thousands of swords. the queen's freedmen are as yet unblooded. the sellswords i do not trust. unsullied are brave soldiers ... but not warriors. not kniqhts. he paused. what happened when you tried to take the dragons? tell me. the dornishmen exchanged a look. then drinkwater said, quentyn told the tattered prince he could control them. it was in his blood, he said. he had targaryen blood. blood of the dragon. yes. the sellswords were supposed to help us get the dragons chained up so we could get them to the docks. rags arranged for a ship, said yronwood. a big one, in case we got both dragons. and quent was going to ride one. he looked at his bandaged hands. the moment we got in, though, you could see none of it was going to work. the dragons were too wild. the chains ... there were bits of broken chain everywhere, big chains, links the size of your head mixed in with all these cracked and splintered bones. and quent, seven save him, he looked like he was going to shit his smallclothes. caggo and meris weren't blind, they saw it too. then one of the cross-bowmen let fly. maybe they meant to kill the dragons all along and were only using us to get to them. you never know with tatters. any way you hack it off, it weren't clever. the quarrel just made the dragons angry, and they hadn't been in such a good mood to start with. then ... then things got bad. and the windblown blew away, said ser gerris. quent was screaming, covered in flames, and they were gone. caggo, pretty meris, all but the dead one. ah, what did you expect, drink? a cat will kill a mouse, a pig will wallow in shit, and a sellsword will run off when he's needed most. can't be blamed. just the nature of the beast. he's not wrong, ser barristan said. what did prince quentyn promise the tattered prince in return for all this help? he got no answer. ser gerris looked at ser archibald. ser archibald looked at his hands, the floor, the door. pentos, said ser barristan. he promised him pentos. say it. no words of yours can help or harm prince quentyn now. aye, said ser archibald unhappily. it was pentos. they made marks on a paper, the two of them. there is a chance here. we still have windblown in the dungeons. those feigned deserters. i remember, said yronwood. hungerford, straw, that lot. some of them weren't so bad for sellswords. others, well, might be they could stand a bit of dying. what of them? i mean to send them back to the tattered prince. and you with them. you will be two amongst thousands. your presence in the yunkish camps should pass unnoticed. i want you to deliver a message to the tattered prince. tell him that i sent you, that i speak with the queen's voice. tell him that we'll pay his price if he delivers us our hostages, unharmed and whole. ser archibald grimaced. rags and tatters is more like to give the two of us to pretty meris. he won't do it. why not? the task is simple enough. compared to stealing dragons. i once brought the queen's father out of duskendale. that was westerns, said gerris drinkwater. this is meereen. arch cannot even hold a sword with those hands. he ought not need to. you will have the sellswords with you, unless i mistake my man. gerris drinkwater pushed back his mop of sun-streaked hair. might we have some time to discuss this amongst ourselves? no, said selmy. i'll do it, offered ser archibald, just so long as there's no bloody boats involved. drink will do it too. he grinned. he don't know it yet, but he will. and that was done. the simple part, at least, thought barristan selmy, as he made the long climb back to the summit of the pyramid. the hard part he'd left in dornish hands. his grandfather would have been aghast. the dornishmen were knights, at least in name, though only yronwood impressed him as having the true steel. drinkwater had a pretty face, a glib tongue, and a fine head of hair. by the time the old knight returned to the queen's rooms atop the pyramid, prince quentyn's corpse had been removed. six of the young cup-bearers were playing some child's game as he entered, sitting in a circle on the floor as they took turns spinning a dagger. when it wobbled to a stop they cut a lock of hair off whichever of them the blade was pointing at. ser barristan had played a similar game with his cousins when he was just a boy at harvest hall ... though in westerns, as he recalled, kissing had been involved as well. bhakaz, he called. a cup of wine, if you would be so good. grazhar, azzak, the door is yours. i am expecting the green grace. show her in at once when she arrives. elsewise, i do not wish to be disturbed. azzak scrambled to his feet. as you command, lord hand. ser barristan went out onto the terrace. the rain had stopped, though a wall of slate-grey clouds hid the setting sun as it made its descent into slaver's bay. a few wisps of smoke still rose from the blackened stones of hazdar, twisted like ribbons by the wind. far off to the east, beyond the city walls, he saw pale wings moving above a distant line of hills. viserion. hunting, mayhaps, or flying just to fly. he wondered where rhaegal was. thus far the green dragon had shown himself to be more dangerous than the white. when bhakaz brought his wine, the old knight took one long swallow and sent the boy for water. a few cups of wine might be just the thing to help him sleep, but he would need his wits about him when galazza galare returned from treating with the foe. so he drank his wine well watered, as the world grew dark around him. he was very tired, and full of doubts. the dornishmen, hizdahr, reznak, the attack ... was he doing the right things? was he doing what daenerys would have wanted? / was not made for this. other kingsguard had served as hand before him. not many, but a few. he had read of them in the white book. now he found himself wondering whether they had felt as lost and confused as he did. lord hand. grazhar stood in the door, a taper in his hand. the green grace has come. you asked to be told. show her in. and light some candles. galazza galare was attended by four pink graces. an aura of wisdom and dignity seemed to surround her that ser barristan could not help but admire. this is a strong woman, and she has been a faithful friend to daenerys. lord hand, she said, her face hidden behind shimmering green veils. may i sit? these bones are old and weary. grazhar, a chair for the green grace. the pink graces arrayed themselves behind her, with eyes lowered and hands clasped before them. may i offer you refreshment? asked ser barristan. that would be most welcome, ser barristan. my throat is dry from talking. a juice, perhaps? as you wish. he beckoned to kezmya and had her fetch the priestess a goblet of lemon juice, sweetened with honey. to drink it, the priestess had to remove her veil, and selmy was reminded of just how old she was. twenty years my elder, or more. if the queen were here, i know she would join me in thanking you for all that you have done for us. her magnificence has always been most gracious. galazza galare finished her drink and fastened up her veil again. have there been any further tidings of our sweet queen? none as yet. i shall pray for her. and what of king hizdahr, if i may be so bold? might i be permitted to see his radiance? soon, i hope. he is unharmed, i promise you. i am pleased to hear that. the wise masters of yunkai asked after him. you will not be surprised to hear that they wish the noble hizdahr to be restored at once to his rightful place. he shall be, if it can be proved that he did not try to kill our queen. until such time, meereen will be ruled by a council of the loyal and just. there is a place for you on that council. i know that you have much to teach us all, your benevolence. we need your wisdom. i fear you flatter me with empty courtesies, lord hand, the green grace said. if you truly think me wise, heed me now. release the noble hizdahr and restore him to his throne. only the queen can do that. beneath her veils, the green grace sighed. the peace that we worked so hard to forge flutters like a leaf in an autumn wind. these are dire days. death stalks our streets, riding the pale mare from thrice-cursed astapor. dragons haunt the skies, feasting on the flesh of children. hundreds are taking ship, sailing for yunkai, for tolos, for qarth, for any refuge that will have them. the pyramid of hazkar has collapsed into a smoking ruin, and many of that ancient line lie dead beneath its blackened stones. the pyramids of uhlez and yherizan have become the lairs of monsters, their masters homeless beggars. my people have lost all hope and turned against the gods themselves, giving over their nights to drunkenness and fornication. and murder. the sons of the harpy slew thirty in the night. i grieve to hear this. all the more reason to free the noble hizdahr zo loraq, who stopped such killings once. and how did he accomplish that, unless he is himself the harpy? her grace gave her hand to hizdahr zo loraq, made him her king and consort, restored the mortal art as he beseeched her. in return he gave her poisoned locusts. in return he gave her peace. do not cast it away, ser, i beg you. peace is the pearl beyond price. hizdahr is of loraq. never would he soil his hands with poison. he is innocent. how can you be certain? unless you know the poisoner. the gods of ghis have told me. my gods are the seven, and the seven have been silent on this matter. your wisdom, did you present my offer? to all the lords and captains of yunkai, as you commanded me ... yet i fear you will not like their answer. they refused? they did. no amount of gold will buy your people back, i was told. only the blood of dragons may set them free again. it was the answer ser barristan had expected, if not the one that he had hoped for. his mouth tightened. i know these were not the words you wished to hear, said galazza galare. yet for myself, i understand. these dragons are fell beasts. yunkai fears them ... and with good cause, you cannot deny. our histories speak of the dragonlords of dread valyria and the devastation that they wrought upon the peoples of old ghis. even your own young queen, fair daenerys who called herself the mother of dragons ... we saw her burning, that day in the pit ... even she was not safe from the dragon's wroth. her grace is not ... she ... ... is dead. may the gods grant her sweet sleep. tears glistened behind her veils. let her dragons die as well. selmy was groping for an answer when he heard the sound of heavy footsteps. the door burst inward, and skahaz mo kandaq stormed in with four brazen beasts behind him. when grazhar tried to block his path, he slammed the boy aside. ser barristan was on his feet at once. what is it? the trebuchets, the shavepate growled. all six. galazza galare rose. thus does yunkai make reply to your offers, ser. i warned you that you would not like their answer. they choose war, then. so be it. ser barristan felt oddly relieved. war he understood. if they think they will break meereen by throwing stones— not stones. the old woman's voice was full of grief, of fear. corpses.
