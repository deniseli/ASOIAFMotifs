the rat squealed as he bit into it, squirming wildly in his hands, frantic to escape. the belly was the softest part. he tore at the sweet meat, the warm blood running over his lips. it was so good that it brought tears to his eyes. his belly rumbled and he swallowed. by the third bite the rat had ceased to struggle, and he was feeling almost content. then he heard the sounds of voices outside the dungeon door. at once he stilled, fearing even to chew. his mouth was full of blood and flesh and hair, but he dare not spit or swallow. he listened in terror, stiff as stone, to the scuff of boots and the clanking of iron keys. no, he thought, no, please gods, not now, not now. it had taken him so long to catch the rat. // they catch me with it, they will take it away, and then they'll tell, and lord ramsay will hurt me. he knew he ought to hide the rat, but he was so hungry. it had been two days since he had eaten, or maybe three. down here in the dark it was hard to tell. though his arms and legs were thin as reeds, his belly was swollen and hollow, and ached so much that he found he could not sleep. whenever he closed his eyes, he found himself remembering lady hornwood. after their wedding, lord ramsay had locked her away in a tower and starved her to death. in the end she had eaten her own fingers. he crouched down in a corner of his cell, clutching his prize under his chin. blood ran from the corners of his mouth as he nibbled at the rat with what remained of his teeth, trying to bolt down as much of the warm flesh as he could before the cell was opened. the meat was stringy, but so rich he thought he might be sick. he chewed and swallowed, picking small bones from the holes in his gums where teeth had been yanked out. it hurt to chew, but he was so hungry he could not stop. the sounds were growing louder. please gods, he isn't coming for me, he prayed, tearing off one of the rat's legs. it had been a long time since anyone had come for him. there were other cells, other prisoners. sometimes he heard them screaming, even through the thick stone walls. the women always scream the loudest. he sucked at the raw meat and tried to spit out the leg bone, but it only dribbled over his lower lip and tangled in his beard. go away, he prayed, go away, pass me by, please, please. but the footsteps stopped just when they were loudest, and the keys clattered right outside the door. the rat fell from his fingers. he wiped his bloody fingers on his breeches. no, he mumbled, noooo. his heels scrabbled at the straw as he tried to push himself into the corner, into the cold damp stonewalls. the sound of the lock turning was the most terrible of all. when the light hit him full in the face, he let out a shriek. he had to cover his eyes with his hands. he would have clawed them out if he'd dared, his head was pounding so. take it away, do it in the dark, please, oh please. that's not him, said a boy's voice. look at him. we've got the wrong cell. last cell on the left, another boy replied. this is the last cell on the left, isn't it? aye. a pause. what's he saying? i don't think he likes the light. would you, if you looked like that? the boy hawked and spat. and the stench of him. i'm like to choke. he's been eating rats, said the second boy. look. the first boy laughed. he has. that's funny. / had to. the rats bit him when he slept, gnawing at his fingers and his toes, even at his face, so when he got his hands on one he did not hesitate. eat or be eaten, those were the only choices. i did it, he mumbled, i did, i did, i ate him, they do the same to me, please ... the boys moved closer, the straw crunching softly under their feet. talk to me, said one of them. he was the smaller of the two, a thin boy, but clever. do you remember who you are? the fear came bubbling up inside him, and he moaned. talk to me. tell me your name. my name. a scream caught in his throat. they had taught him his name, they had, they had, but it had been so long that he'd forgotten. if i say it wrong, he'll take another finger, or worse, he'll ... he'll ... he would not think about that, he could not think about that. there were needles in his jaw, in his eyes. his head was pounding. please, he squeaked, his voice thin and weak. he sounded a hundred years old. perhaps he was. how long have i been in here? go, he mumbled, through broken teeth and broken fingers, his eyes closed tight against the terrible bright light. please, you can have the rat, don't hurt me ... reek, said the larger of the boys. your name is reek. remember? he was the one with the torch. the smaller boy had the ring of iron keys. reek? tears ran down his cheeks. i remember. i do. his mouth opened and closed. my name is reek. it rhymes with leek. in the dark he did not need a name, so it was easy to forget. reek, reek, my name is reek. he had not been born with that name. in another life he had been someone else, but here and now, his name was reek. he remembered. he remembered the boys as well. they were clad in matching lambs-wool doublets, silver-grey with dark blue trim. both were squires, both were eight, and both were walder frey. big walder and little walder, yes. only the big one was little and the little one was big, which amused the boys and confused the rest of the world. i know you, he whispered, through cracked lips. i know your names. you're to come with us, said little walder. his lordship has need of you, said big walder. fear went through him like a knife. they are only children, he thought. two boys of eight. he could overcome two boys of eight, surely. even as weak as he was, he could take the torch, take the keys, take the dagger sheathed on little walder's hip, escape. no. no, it is too easy. it is a trap. if i run, he will take another finger from me, he will take more of my teeth. he had run before. years ago, it seemed, when he still had some strength in him, when he had still been defiant. that time it had been kyra with the keys. she told him she had stolen them, that she knew a postern gate that was never guarded. take me back to winterfell, m'lord, she begged, pale-faced and trembling. i don't know the way. i can't escape alone. come with me, please. and so he had. the gaoler was dead drunk in a puddle of wine, with his breeches down around his ankles. the dungeon door was open and the postern gate had been unguarded, just as she had said. they waited for the moon to go behind a cloud, then slipped from the castle and splashed across the weeping water, stumbling over stones, half-frozen by the icy stream. on the far side, he had kissed her. you've saved us, he said. fool. fool. it had all been a trap, a game, a jape. lord ramsay loved the chase and preferred to hunt two-legged prey. all night they ran through the darkling wood, but as the sun came up the sound of a distant horn came faintly through the trees, and they heard the baying of a pack of hounds. we should split up, he told kyra as the dogs drew closer. they cannot track us both. the girl was crazed with fear, though, and refused to leave his side, even when he swore that he would raise a host of ironborn and come back for her if she should be the one they followed. within the hour, they were taken. one dog knocked him to the ground, and a second bit kyra on the leg as she scrambled up a hillside. the rest surrounded them, baying and snarling, snapping at them every time they moved, holding them there until ramsay snow rode up with his hunts-men. he was still a bastard then, not yet a bolton. there you are, he said, smiling down at them from the saddle. you wound me, wandering off like this. have you grown tired of my hospitality so soon? that was when kyra seized a stone and threw it at his head. it missed by a good foot, and ramsay smiled. you must be punished. reek remembered the desperate, frightened look in kyra's eyes. she had never looked so young as she did in that moment, still half a girl, but there was nothing he could do. she brought them down on us, he thought. // we had separated as i wanted, one of us might have gotten away. the memory made it hard to breathe. reek turned away from the torch with tears glimmering in his eyes. what does he want of me this time? he thought, despairing. why won't he just leave me be? i did no wrong, not this time, why won't they just leave me in the dark? he'd had a rat, a fat one, warm and wriggling ... should we wash him? asked little walder. his lordship likes him stinky, said big walder. that's why he named him reek. reek. my name is reek, it rhymes with bleak. he had to remember that. serve and obey and remember who you are, and no more harm will come to you. he promised, his lordship promised. even if he had wanted to resist, he did not have the strength. it had been scourged from him, starved from him, flayed from him. when little walder pulled him up and big walder waved the torch at him to herd him from the cell, he went along as docile as a dog. if he'd had a tail, he would have tucked it down between his legs. if i had a tail, the bastard would have cut it off. the thought came unbidden, a vile thought, dangerous. his lordship was not a bastard anymore. bolton, not snow. the boy king on the iron throne had made lord ramsay legitimate, giving him the right to use his lord father's name. calling him snow reminded him of his bastardy and sent him into a black rage. reek must remember that. and his name, he must remember his name. for half a heartbeat it eluded him, and that frightened him so badly that he tripped on the steep dungeon steps and tore his breeches open on the stone, drawing blood. little walder had to shove the torch at him to get him back on his feet and moving again. out in the yard, night was settling over the dreadfort and a full moon was rising over the castle's eastern walls. its pale light cast the shadows of the tall triangular merlons across the frozen ground, a line of sharp black teeth. the air was cold and damp and full of half-forgotten smells. the world. reek told himself, this is what the world smells like. he did not know how long he had been down there in the dungeons, but it had to have been half a year at least. that long, or longer. what if it has been five years, or ten, or twenty? would i even know? what if i went mad down there, and half my life is gone? but no, that was folly. it could not have been so long. the boys were still boys. if it had been ten years, they would have grown into men. he had to remember that. / must not let him drive me mad. he can take my fingers and my toes, he can put out my eyes and slice my ears off, but he cannot take my wits unless i let him. little walder led the way with torch in hand. reek followed meekly, with big walder just behind him. the dogs in the kennels barked as they went by. wind swirled through the yard, cutting through the thin cloth of the filthy rags he wore and raising gooseprickles on his skin. the night air was cold and damp, but he saw no sign of snow though surely winter was close at hand. reek wondered if he would be alive to see the snows come. how many fingers will i have? how many toes? when he raised a hand, he was shocked to see how white it was, how flesh less. skin and bones, he thought. / have an old man's hands. could he have been wrong about the boys? what if they were not little walder and big walder after all, but the sons of the boys he'd known? the great hall was dim and smoky. rows of torches burned to left and right, grasped by skeletal human hands jutting from the walls. high overhead were wooden rafters black from smoke, and a vaulted ceiling lost in shadow. the air was heavy with the smells of wine and ale and roasted meat. reek's stomach rumbled noisily at the scents, and his mouth began to water. little walder pushed him stumbling past the long tables where the men of the garrison were eating. he could feel their eyes upon him. the best places, up near the dais, were occupied by ramsay's favorites, the bastard's boys. ben bones, the old man who kept his lordship's beloved hunting hounds. damon, called damon dance-for-me, fair-haired and boyish. grunt, who had lost his tongue for speaking carelessly in lord roose's hearing. sour alyn. skinner. yellow dick. farther down, below the salt, were others that reek knew by sight if not by name: sworn swords and serjeants, soldiers and gaolers and torturers. but there were strangers too, faces he did not know. some wrinkled their noses as he passed, whilst others laughed at the sight of him. guests, reek thought, his lordship's friends, and i am brought up to amuse them. a shiver of fear went through him. at the high table the bastard of bolton sat in his lord father's seat, drinking from his father's cup. two old men shared the high table with him, and reek knew at a glance that both were lords. one was gaunt, with flinty eyes, a long white beard, and a face as hard as a winter frost. his jerkin was a ragged bearskin, worn and greasy. underneath he wore a ringmail byrnie, even at table. the second lord was thin as well, but twisted where the first was straight. one of his shoulders was much higher than the other, and he stooped over his trencher like a vulture over carrion. his eyes were grey and greedy, his teeth yellow, his forked beard a tangle of snow and silver. only a few wisps of white hair still clung to his spotted skull, but the cloak he wore was soft and fine, grey wool trimmed with black sable and fastened at the shoulder with a starburst wrought in beaten silver. ramsay was clad in black and pink— black boots, black belt and scabbard, black leather jerkin over a pink velvet doublet slashed with dark red satin. in his right ear gleamed a garnet cut in the shape of a drop of blood. yet for all the splendor of his garb, he remained an ugly man, big-boned and slope-shouldered, with a fleshiness to him that suggested that in later life he would run to fat. his skin was pink and blotchy, his nose broad, his mouth small, his hair long and dark and dry. his lips were wide and meaty, but the thing men noticed first about him were his eyes. he had his lord father's eyes— small, close-set, queerly pale. ghost grey, some men called the shade, but in truth his eyes were all but colorless, like two chips of dirty ice. at the sight of reek, he smiled a wet-lipped smile. there he is. my sour old friend. to the men beside him he said, reek has been with me since i was a boy. my lord father gave him to me as a token of his love. the two lords exchanged a look. i had heard your serving man was dead, said the one with the stooped shoulder. slain by the starks, they said. lord ramsay chuckled. the ironmen will tell you that what is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger. like reek. he smells of the grave, though, i grant you that. he smells of nightsoil and stale vomit. the stoop-shouldered old lord tossed aside the bone that he'd been gnawing on and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth. is there some reason you must needs inflict him upon us whilst we're eating? the second lord, the straight-backed old man in the mail byrnie, studied reek with flinty eyes. look again, he urged the other lord. his hair's gone white and he is three stone thinner, aye, but this is no serving man. have you forgotten? the crookback lord looked again and gave a sudden snort. him? can it be? stark's ward. smiling, always smiling. he smiles less often now, lord ramsay confessed. i may have broken some of his pretty white teeth. you would have done better to slit his throat, said the lord in mail. a dog who turns against his master is fit for naught but skinning. oh, he's been skinned, here and there, said ramsay. yes, my lord. i was bad, my lord. insolent and ... he licked his lip, trying to think of what else he had done. serve and obey, he told himself, and he'll let you live, and keep the parts that you still have. serve and obey and remember your name. reek, reek, it rhymes with meek. ... bad and ... there's blood on your mouth, ramsay observed. have you been chewing on your fingers again, reek? no. no, my lord, i swear. reek had tried to bite his own ring finger off once, to stop it hurting after they had stripped the skin from it. lord ramsay would never simply cut off a man's finger. he preferred to flay it and let the exposed flesh dry and crack and fester. reek had been whipped and racked and cut, but there was no pain half so excruciating as the pain that followed flaying. it was the sort of pain that drove men mad, and it could not be endured for long. soon or late the victim would scream, please, no more, no more, stop it hurting, cut it off, and lord ramsay would oblige. it was a game they played. reek had learned the rules, as his hands and feet could testify, but that one time he had forgotten and tried to end the pain himself, with his teeth. ramsay had not been pleased, and the offense had cost reek another toe. i ate a rat, he mumbled. a rat? ramsay's pale eyes glittered in the torchlight. all the rats in the dreadfort belong to my lord father. how dare you make a meal of one without my leave. reek did not know what to say, so he said nothing. one wrong word could cost him another toe, even a finger. thus far he had lost two fingers off his left hand and the pinky off his right, but only the little toe off his right foot against three from his left. sometimes ramsay would make japes about balancing him out. my lord was only japing, he tried to tell himself. he does not want to hurt me, he told me so, he only does it when i give him cause. his lord was merciful and kind. he might have flayed his face off for some of the things reek had said, before he'd learned his true name and proper place. this grows tedious, said the lord in the mail byrnie. kill him and be done with it. lord ramsay filled his cup with ale. that would spoil our celebration, my lord. reek, i have glad tidings for you. i am to be wed. my lord father is bringing me a stark girl. lord eddard's daughter, arya. you remember little arya, don't you? arya underfoot, he almost said. arya horseface. robb's younger sister, brown-haired, long-faced, skinny as a stick, always dirty. sansa was the pretty one. he remembered a time when he had thought that lord eddard stark might marry him to sansa and claim him for a son, but that had only been a child's fancy. arya, though ... i remember her. arya. she shall be the lady of winterfell, and me her lord. she is only a girl. yes, my lord. congratulations. will you attend me at my wedding, reek? he hesitated. if you wish it, my lord. oh, i do. he hesitated again, wondering if this was some cruel trap. yes, my lord. if it please you. i would be honored. we must take you out of that vile dungeon, then. scrub you pink again, get you some clean clothes, some food to eat. some nice soft porridge, would you like that? perhaps a pease pie laced with bacon. i have a little task for you, and you'll need your strength back if you are to serve me. you do want to serve me, i know. yes, my lord. more than anything. a shiver went through him. i'm your reek. please let me serve you. please. since you ask so nicely, how can i deny you? ramsay bolton smiled. i ride to war, reek. and you will be coming with me, to help me fetch home my virgin bride. they gave him a horse and a banner, a soft woolen doublet and a warm fur cloak, and set him loose. for once, he did not stink. come back with that castle, said damon dance-for-me as he helped reek climb shaking into the saddle, or keep going and see how far you get before we catch you. he'd like that, he would. grinning, damon gave the horse a lick across the rump with his whip, and the old stot whinnied and lurched into motion. reek did not dare to look back, for fear that damon and yellow dick and grunt and the rest were coming after him, that all of this was just another of lord ramsay's japes, some cruel test to see what he would do if they gave him a horse and set him free. do they think that i will run? the stot they had given him was a wretched thing, knock-kneed and half-starved; he could never hope to outdistance the fine horses lord ramsay and his hunters would be riding. and ramsay loved nothing more than to set his girls baying on the trail of some fresh prey. besides, where would he run to? behind him were the camps, crowded with dreadfort men and those the ryswells had brought from the rills, with the barrowton host between them. south of moat cailin, another army was coming up the causeway, an army of boltons and freys marching beneath the banners of the dreadfort. east of the road lay a bleak and barren shore and a cold salt sea, to the west the swamps and bogs of the neck, infested with serpents, lizard lions, and bog devils with their poisoned arrows. he would not run. he could not run. / will deliver him the castle. i will. i must. it was a grey day, damp and misty. the wind was from the south, moist as a kiss. the ruins of moat cailin were visible in the distance, threaded through with wisps of morning mist. his horse moved toward them at a walk, her hooves making faint wet squelching sounds as they pulled free of the grey-green muck. / have come this way before. it was a dangerous thought, and he regretted it at once. no, he said, no, that was some other man, that was before you knew your name. his name was reek. he had to remember that. reek, reek, it rhymes with leek. when that other man had come this way, an army had followed close behind him, the great host of the north riding to war beneath the grey-and-white banners of house stark. reek rode alone, clutching a peace banner on a pinewood staff. when that other man had come this way, he had been mounted on a courser, swift and spirited. reek rode a broken-down stot, all skin and bone and ribs, and he rode her slowly for fear he might fall off. the other man had been a good rider, but reek was uneasy on horseback. it had been so long. he was no rider. he was not even a man. he was lord ramsay's creature, lower than a dog, a worm in human skin. you will pretend to be a prince, lord ramsay told him last night, as reek was soaking in a tub of scalding water, but we know the truth. you're reek. you'll always be reek, no matter how sweet you smell. your nose may lie to you. remember your name. remember who you are. reek, he said. your reek. do this little thing for me, and you can be my dog and eat meat every day, lord ramsay promised. you will be tempted to betray me. to run or fight or join our foes. no, quiet, i'll not hear you deny it. lie to me, and i'll take your tongue. a man would turn against me in your place, but we know what you are, don't we? betray me if you want, it makes no matter ... but count your fingers first and know the cost. reek knew the cost. seven, he thought, seven fingers. a man can make do with seven fingers. seven is a sacred number. he remembered how much it had hurt when lord ramsay had commanded skinner to lay his ring finger bare. the air was wet and heavy, and shallow pools of water dotted the ground. reek picked his way between them carefully, following the remnants of the log-and-plank road that robb stark's vanguard had laid down across the soft ground to speed the passage of his host. where once a mighty curtain wall had stood, only scattered stones remained, blocks of black basalt so large it must once have taken a hundred men to hoist them into place. some had sunk so deep into the bog that only a corner showed; others lay strewn about like some god's abandoned toys, cracked and crumbling, spotted with lichen. last night's rain had left the huge stones wet and glistening, and the morning sunlight made them look as if they were coated in some fine black oil. beyond stood the towers. the drunkard's tower leaned as if it were about to collapse, just as it had for half a thousand years. the children's tower thrust into the sky as straight as a spear, but its shattered top was open to the wind and rain. the gatehouse tower, squat and wide, was the largest of the three, slimy with moss, a gnarled tree growing sideways from the stones of its north side, fragments of broken wall still standing to the east and west. the karstarks took the drunkard's tower and the umbers the children's tower, he recalled. robb claimed the gatehouse tower for his own. if he closed his eyes, he could see the banners in his mind's eye, snapping bravely in a brisk north wind. all gone now, all fallen. the wind on his cheeks was blowing from the south, and the only banners flying above the remains of moat cailin displayed a golden kraken on a field of black. he was being watched. he could feel the eyes. when he looked up, he caught a glimpse of pale faces peering from behind the battlements of the gatehouse tower and through the broken masonry that crowned the children's tower, where legend said the children of the forest had once called down the hammer of the waters to break the lands of westeros in two. the only dry road through the neck was the causeway, and the towers of moat cailin plugged its northern end like a cork in a bottle. the road was narrow, the ruins so positioned that any enemy coming up from the south must pass beneath and between them. to assault any of the three towers, an attacker must expose his back to arrows from the other two, whilst climbing damp stone walls festooned with streamers of slimy white ghostskin. the swampy ground beyond the causeway was impassable, an endless morass of suckholes, quicksands, and glistening green swards that looked solid to the unwary eye but turned to water the instant you trod upon them, the whole of it infested with venomous serpents and poisonous flowers and monstrous lizard lions with teeth like daggers. just as dangerous were its people, seldom seen but always lurking, the swamp-dwellers, the frog-eaters, the mud-men. fenn and reed, peat and boggs, cray and quagg, greengood and blackmyre, those were the sorts of names they gave themselves. the ironborn called them all bog devils. reek passed the rotted carcass of a horse, an arrow jutting from its neck. a long white snake slithered into its empty eye socket at his approach. behind the horse he spied the rider, or what remained of him. the crows had stripped the flesh from the man's face, and a feral dog had burrowed beneath his mail to get at his entrails. farther on, another corpse had sunk so deep into the muck that only his face and fingers showed. closer to the towers, corpses littered the ground on every side. blood-blooms had sprouted from their gaping wounds, pale flowers with petals plump and moist as a woman's lips. the garrison will never know me. some might recall the boy he'd been before he learned his name, but reek would be a stranger to them. it had been a long while since he last looked into a glass, but he knew how old he must appear. his hair had turned white; much of it had fallen out, and what was left was stiff and dry as straw. the dungeons had left him weak as an old woman and so thin a strong wind could knock him down. and his hands ... ramsay had given him gloves, fine gloves of black leather, soft and supple, stuffed with wool to conceal his missing fingers, but if anyone looked closely, he would see that three of his fingers did not bend. no closer! a voice rang out. what do you want? words. he spurred the stot onward, waving the peace banner so they could not fail to see it. i come unarmed. there was no reply. inside the walls, he knew, the ironmen were discussing whether to admit him or fill his chest with arrows. it makes no matter. a quick death here would be a hundred times better than returning to lord ramsay as a failure. then the gatehouse doors flung open. quickly. reek was turning toward the sound when the arrow struck. it came from somewhere to his right, where broken chunks of the curtain wall lay half-submerged beneath the bog. the shaft tore through the folds of his banner and hung spent, the point a bare foot from his face. it startled him so badly that he dropped the peace banner and tumbled from his saddle. inside, the voice shouted, hurry, fool, hurryv reek scrambled up the steps on hands and knees as another arrow fluttered over his head. someone seized him and dragged him inside, and he heard the door crash shut behind him. he was pulled to his feet and shoved against a wall. then a knife was at his throat, a bearded face so close to his that he could count the man's nose hairs. who are you? what's your purpose here? quick now, or i'll do you the same as him. the guard jerked his head toward a body rotting on the floor beside the door, its flesh green and crawling with maggots. i am ironborn, reek answered, lying. the boy he'd been before had been ironborn, true enough, but reek had come into this world in the dungeons of the dreadfort. look at my face. i am lord balon's son. your prince. he would have said the name, but somehow the words caught in his throat. reek, i'm reek, it rhymes with squeak. he had to forget that for a little while, though. no man would ever yield to a creature such as reek, no matter how desperate his situation. he must pretend to be a prince again. his captor stared at his face, squinting, his mouth twisted in suspicion. his teeth were brown, and his breath stank of ale and onion. lord balon's sons were killed. my brothers. not me. lord ramsay took me captive after winterfell. he's sent me here to treat with you. do you command here? me? the man lowered his knife and took a step backwards, almost stumbling over the corpse. not me, m'lord. his mail was rusted, his leathers rotting. on the back of one hand an open sore wept blood. ralf kenning has the command. the captain said. i'm on the door, is all. and who is this? reek gave the corpse a kick. the guard stared at the dead man as if seeing him for the first time. him ... he drank the water. i had to cut his throat for him, to stop his screaming. bad belly. you can't drink the water. that's why we got the ale. the guard rubbed his face, his eyes red and inflamed. we used to drag the dead down into the cellars. all the vaults are flooded down there. no one wants to take the trouble now, so we just leave them where they fall. the cellar is a better place for them. give them to the water. to the drowned god. the man laughed. no gods down there, m'lord. only rats and water snakes. white things, thick as your leg. sometimes they slither up the steps and bite you in your sleep. reek remembered the dungeons underneath the dreadfort, the rat squirming between his teeth, the taste of warm blood on his lips. if i fail, ramsay will send me back to that, but first he'll flay the skin from another finger. how many of the garrison are left? some, said the ironman. i don't know. fewer than we was before. some in the drunkard's tower too, i think. not the children's tower. dagon codd went over there a few days back. only two men left alive, he said, and they was eating on the dead ones. he killed them both, if you can believe that. moat cailin has fallen, reek realized then, only no one has seen fit to tell them. he rubbed his mouth to hide his broken teeth, and said, i need to speak with your commander. kenning? the guard seemed confused. he don't have much to say these days. he's dying. might be he's dead. i haven't seen him since ... i don't remember when ... where is he? take me to him. who will keep the door, then? him. reek gave the corpse a kick. that made the man laugh. aye. why not? come with me, then. he pulled a torch down from a wall sconce and waved it till it blazed up bright and hot. this way. the guard led him through a door and up a spiral stair, the torchlight glimmering off black stone walls as they climbed. the chamber at the top of the steps was dark, smoky, and oppressively hot. a ragged skin had been hung across the narrow window to keep the damp out, and a slab of peat smoldered in a brazier. the smell in the room was foul, a miasma of mold and piss and nightsoil, of smoke and sickness. soiled rushes covered the floor, whilst a heap of straw in the corner passed for a bed. ralf kenning lay shivering beneath a mountain of furs. his arms were stacked beside him— sword and axe, mail hauberk, iron warhelm. his shield bore the storm god's cloudy hand, lightning crackling from his fingers down to a raging sea, but the paint was discolored and peeling, the wood beneath starting to rot. ralf was rotting too. beneath the furs he was naked and feverish, his pale puffy flesh covered with weeping sores and scabs. his head was misshapen, one cheek grotesquely swollen, his neck so engorged with blood that it threatened to swallow his face. the arm on that same side was big as a log and crawling with white worms. no one had bathed him or shaved him for many days, from the look of him. one eye wept pus, and his beard was crusty with dried vomit. what happened to him? asked reek. he was on the parapets and some bog devil loosed an arrow at him. it was only a graze, but ... they poison their shafts, smear the points with shit and worse things. we poured boiling wine into the wound, but it made no difference. / cannot treat with this thing. kill him, reek told the guard. his wits are gone. he's full of blood and worms. the man gaped at him. the captain put him in command. you'd put a dying horse down. what horse? i never had no horse. / did. the memory came back in a rush. smiler's screams had sounded almost human. his mane afire, he had reared up on his hind legs, blind with pain, lashing out with his hooves. no, no. not mine, he was not mine, reek never had a horse. i will kill him for you. reek snatched up ra if kenning's sword where it leaned against his shield. he still had fingers enough to clasp the hilt. when he laid the edge of the blade against the swollen throat of the creature on the straw, the skin split open in a gout of black blood and yellow pus. kenning jerked violently, then lay still. an awful stench filled the room. reek bolted for the steps. the air was damp and cold there, but much cleaner by comparison. the ironman stumbled out after him, white-faced and struggling not to retch. reek grasped him by the arm. who was second-in-command? where are the rest of the men? up on the battlements, or in the hall. sleeping, drinking. i'll take you if you like. do it now. ramsay had only given him a day. the hall was dark stone, high ceilinged and drafty, full of drifting smoke, its stone walls spotted by huge patches of pale lichen. a peat fire burned low in a hearth blackened by the hotter blazes of years past. a massive table of carved stone filled the chamber, as it had for centuries. there was where i sat, the last time i was here, he remembered. robb was at the head of the table, with the greatjon to his right and roose bolton on his left. the glovers sat next to helman tallhart. karstark and his sons were across from them. two dozen ironborn sat drinking at the table. a few looked at him with dull, flat eyes when he entered. the rest ignored him. all the men were strangers to him. several wore cloaks fastened by brooches in the shape of silver codfish. the codds were not well regarded in the iron islands; the men were said to be thieves and cowards, the women wantons who bedded with their own fathers and brothers. it did not surprise him that his uncle had chosen to leave these men behind when the iron fleet went home. this will make my task that much easier. ralf kenning is dead, he said. who commands here? the drinkers stared at him blankly. one laughed. another spat. finally one of the codds said, who asks? lord balon's son. reek, my name is reek, it rhymes with cheek. i am here at the command of ramsay bolton, lord of the hornwood and heir to the dreadfort, who captured me at winterfell. his host is north of you, his father's to the south, but lord ramsay is prepared to be merciful if you yield moat cailin to him before the sun goes down. he drew out the letter that they'd given him and tossed it on the table before the drinkers. one of them picked it up and turned it over in his hands, picking at the pink wax that sealed it. after a moment he said, parchment. what good is that? it's cheese we need, and meat. steel, you mean, said the man beside him, a greybeard whose left arm ended in a stump. swords. axes. aye, and bows, a hundred more bows, and men to loose the arrows. ironborn do not surrender, said a third voice. tell that to my father. lord balon bent the knee when robert broke his wall. elsewise he would have died. as you will if you do not yield. he gestured at the parchment. break the seal. read the words. that is a safe conduct, written in lord ramsay's own hand. give up your swords and come with me, and his lordship will feed you and give you leave to march unmolested to the stony shore and find a ship for home. elsewise you die. is that a threat? one of the codds pushed to his feet. a big man, but pop-eyed and wide of mouth, with dead white flesh. he looked as if his father had sired him on a fish, but he still wore a longsword. dagon codd yields to no man. no, please, you have to listen. the thought of what ramsay would do to him if he crept back to camp without the garrison's surrender was almost enough to make him piss his breeches. reek, reek, it rhymes with leak. is that your answer? the words rang feebly in his ears. does this codfish speak for all of you? the guard who had met him at the door seemed less certain. victarion commanded us to hold, he did. i heard him with my own ears. hold here till i return, he told kenning. aye, said the one-armed man. that's what he said. the kingsmoot called, but he swore that he'd be back, with a driftwood crown upon his head and a thousand men behind him. my uncle is never coming back, reek told them. the kingswood crowned his brother euron, and the crow's eye has other wars to fight. you think my uncle values you? he doesn't. you are the ones he left behind to die. he scraped you off the same way he scrapes mud off his boots when he wades ashore. those words struck home. he could see it in their eyes, in the way they looked at one another or frowned above their cups. they all feared they'd been abandoned, but it took me to turn fear into certainty. these were not the kin of famous captains nor the blood of the great houses of the iron islands. these were the sons of thralls and salt wives. if we yield, we walk away? said the one-armed man. is that what it says on this here writing? he nudged the roll of parchment, its wax seal still unbroken. read it for yourself, he answered, though he was almost certain that none of them could read. lord ramsay treats his captives honorably so long as they keep faith with him. he has only taken toes and fingers and that other thing, when he might have had my tongue, or peeled the skin off my legs from heel to thigh. yield up your swords to him, and you will live. liar. dagon codd drew his longsword. you're the one they call turncloak. why should we believe your promises? he is drunk, reek realized. the ale is speaking. believe what you want. i have brought lord ramsay's message. now i must return to him. we'll sup on wild boar and neeps, washed down with strong red wine. those who come with me will be welcome at the feast. the rest of you will die within a day. the lord of the dreadfort will bring his knights up the causeway, whilst his son leads his own men down on you from the north. no quarter will be granted. the ones that die fighting will be the lucky ones. those who live will be given to the bog devils. enough, snarled dagon codd. you think you can frighten ironborn with words? begone. run back to your master before i open your belly, pull your entrails out, and make you eat them. he might have said more, but suddenly his eyes gaped wide. a throwing axe sprouted from the center of his forehead with a solid thunk. codd's sword fell from his fingers. he jerked like a fish on a hook, then crashed face-first onto the table. it was the one-armed man who'd flung the axe. as he rose to his feet he had another in his hand. who else wants to die? he asked the other drinkers. speak up, i'll see you do. thin red streams were spreading out across the stone from the pool of blood where dagon codd's head had come to rest. me, i mean to live, and that don't mean staying here to rot. one man took a swallow of ale. another turned his cup over to wash away a finger of blood before it reached the place where he was seated. no one spoke. when the one-armed man slid the throwing axe back through his belt, reek knew he had won. he almost felt a man again. lord ramsay will be pleased with me. he pulled down the kraken banner with his own two hands, fumbling some because of his missing fingers but thankful for the fingers that lord ramsay had allowed him to keep. it took the better part of the afternoon before the ironborn were ready to depart. there were more of them than he would have guessed— forty-seven in the gatehouse tower and another eighteen in the drunkard's tower. two of those were so close to dead there was no hope for them, another five too weak to walk. that still left fifty-eight who were fit enough to fight. weak as they were, they would have taken three times their own number with them if lord ramsay had stormed the ruins. he did well to send me, reek told himself as he climbed back onto his stot to lead his ragged column back across the boggy ground to where the northmen were encamped. leave your weapons here, he told the prisoners. swords, bows, daggers. armed men will be slain on sight. it took them thrice as long to cover the distance as it had taken reek alone. crude litters had been patched together for four of the men who could not walk; the fifth was carried by his son, upon his back. it made for slow going, and all the ironborn were well aware of how exposed they were, well within bowshot of the bog devils and their poisoned arrows. if i die, i die. reek only prayed the archer knew his business, so death would be quick and clean. a man's death, not the end ralf kenning suffered. the one-armed man walked at the head of the procession, limping heavily. his name, he said, was adrack humble, and he had a rock wife and three salt wives back on great wyk. three of the four had big bellies when we sailed, he boasted, and humbles run to twins. first thing i'll need to do when i get back is count up my new sons. might be i'll even name one after you, m'lord. aye, name him reek, he thought, and when he's bad you can cut his toes off and give him rats to eat. he turned his head and spat, and wondered if ralf kenning hadn't been the lucky one. a light rain had begun to piss down out of the slate-grey sky by the time lord ramsay's camp appeared in front of them. a sentry watched them pass in silence. the air was full of drifting smoke from the cookfires drowning in the rain. a column of riders came wheeling up behind them, led by a lordling with a horsehead on his shield. one of lord ryswell's sons, reek knew. roger, or maybe rickard. he could not tell the two of them apart. is this all of them? the rider asked from atop a chestnut stallion. all who weren't dead, my lord. i thought there would be more. we came at them three times, and three times they threw us back. we are ironborn, he thought, with a sudden flash of pride, and for half a heartbeat he was a prince again, lord balon's son, the blood of pyke. even thinking was dangerous, though. he had to remember his name. reek, my name is reek, it rhymes with weak. they were just outside the camp when the baying of a pack of hounds told of lord ramsay's approach. whoresbane was with him, along with half a dozen of his favorites, skinner and sour alyn and damon dance-for-me, and the walders big and little too. the dogs swarmed around them, snapping and snarling at the strangers. the bastard's girls, reek thought, before he remembered that one must never, never, never use that word in ramsay's presence. reek swung down from his saddle and took a knee. my lord, moat cailin is yours. here are its last defenders. so few. i had hoped for more. they were such stubborn foes. lord ramsay's pale eyes shone. you must be starved. damon, alyn, see to them. wine and ale, and all the food that they can eat. skinner, show their wounded to our maesters. aye, my lord. a few of the ironborn muttered thanks before they shambled off toward the cookfires in the center of the camp. one of the codds even tried to kiss lord ramsay's ring, but the hounds drove him back before he could get close, and alison took a chunk of his ear. even as the blood streamed down his neck, the man bobbed and bowed and praised his lordship's mercy. when the last of them were gone, ramsay bolton turned his smile on reek. he clasped him by the back of the head, pulled his face close, kissed him on his cheek, and whispered, my old friend reek. did they really take you for their prince? what bloody fools, these ironmen. the gods are laughing. all they want is to go home, my lord. and what do you want, my sweet reek? ramsay murmured, as softly as a lover. his breath smelled of mulled wine and cloves, so sweet. such valiant service deserves a reward. i cannot give you back your fingers or your toes, but surely there is something you would have of me. shall i free you instead? release you from my service? do you want to go with them, return to your bleak isles in the cold grey sea, be a prince again? or would you sooner stay my leal serving man? a cold knife scraped along his spine. be careful, he told himself, be very, very careful. he did not like his lordship's smile, the way his eyes were shining, the spittle glistening at the corner of his mouth. he had seen such signs before. you are no prince. you're reek, just reek, it rhymes with freak. give him the answer that he wants. my lord, he said, my place is here, with you. i'm your reek. i only want to serve you. all i ask ... a skin of wine, that would be reward enough for me ... red wine, the strongest that you have, all the wine a man can drink ... lord ramsay laughed. you're not a man, reek. you're just my creature. you'll have your wine, though. walder, see to it. and fear not, i won't return you to the dungeons, you have my word as a bolton. we'll make a dog of you instead. meat every day, and i'll even leave you teeth enough to eat it. you can sleep beside my girls. ben, do you have a collar for him? i'll have one made, m'lord, said old ben bones. the old man did better than that. that night, besides the collar, there was a ragged blanket too, and half a chicken. reek had to fight the dogs for the meat, but it was the best meal he'd had since winterfell. and the wine ... the wine was dark and sour, but strong. squatting amongst the hounds, reek drank until his head swam, retched, wiped his mouth, and drank some more. afterward he lay back and closed his eyes. when he woke a dog was licking vomit from his beard, and dark clouds were scuttling across the face of a sickle moon. somewhere in the night, men were screaming. he shoved the dog aside, rolled over, and went back to sleep. the next morning lord ramsay dispatched three riders down the causeway to take word to his lord father that the way was clear. the flayed man of house bolton was hoisted above the gatehouse tower, where reek had hauled down the golden kraken of pyke. along the rotting-plank road, wooden stakes were driven deep into the boggy ground; there the corpses festered, red and dripping. sixty-three, he knew, there are sixty-three of them. one was short half an arm. another had a parchment shoved between its teeth, its wax seal still unbroken. three days later, the vanguard of roose bolton's host threaded its way through the ruins and past the row of grisly sentinels— four hundred mounted freys clad in blue and grey, their spearpoints glittering whenever the sun broke through the clouds. two of old lord walder's sons led the van. one was brawny, with a massive jut of jaw and arms thick with muscle. the other had hungry eyes close-set above a pointed nose, a thin brown beard that did not quite conceal the weak chin beneath it, a bald head. hosteen and aenys. he remembered them from before he knew his name. hosteen was a bull, slow to anger but implacable once roused, and by repute the fiercest fighter of lord walder's get. aenys was older, crueler, and more clever— a commander, not a swordsman. both were seasoned soldiers. the northmen followed hard behind the van, their tattered banners strea ming in the wind. reek watched them pass. most were afoot, and there were so few of them. he remembered the great host that marched south with young wolf, beneath the direwolf of winterfell. twenty thousand swords and spears had gone off to war with robb, or near enough to make no matter, but only two in ten were coming back, and most of those were dreadfort men. back where the press was thickest at the center of the column rode a man armored in dark grey plate over a quilted tunic of blood-red leather. his rondels were wrought in the shape of human heads, with open mouths that shrieked in agony. from his shoulders streamed a pink woolen cloak embroidered with droplets of blood. long streamers of red silk fluttered from the top of his closed helm. no crannogman will slay roose bolton with a poisoned arrow. reek thought when he first saw him. an enclosed wagon groaned along behind him, drawn by six heavy draft horses and defended by crossbowmen, front and rear. curtains of dark blue velvet concealed the wagon's occupants from watching eyes. farther back came the baggage train— lumbering wayns laden with provisions and loot taken in the war, and carts crowded with wounded men and cripples. and at the rear, more freys. at least a thousand, maybe more: bowmen, spearmen, peasants armed with scythes and sharpened sticks, freeriders and mounted archers, and another hundred knights to stiffen them. collared and chained and back in rags again, reek followed with the other dogs at lord ramsay's heels when his lordship strode forth to greet his father. when the rider in the dark armor removed his helm, however, the face beneath was not one that reek knew. ramsay's smile curdled at the sight, and anger flashed across his face. what is this, some mockery? just caution, whispered roose bolton, as he emerged from behind the curtains of the enclosed wagon. the lord of the dreadfort did not have a strong likeness to his bastard son. his face was clean-shaved, smooth-skinned, ordinary, not handsome but not quite plain. though roose had been in battles, he bore no scars. though well past forty, he was as yet unwrinkled, with scarce a line to tell of the passage of time. his lips were so thin that when he pressed them together they seemed to vanish altogether. there was an agelessness about him, a stillness; on roose bolton's face, rage and joy looked much the same. all he and ramsay had in common were their eyes. his eyes are ice. reek wondered if roose bolton ever cried. if so, do the tears feel cold upon his cheeks? once, a boy called theon greyjoy had enjoyed tweaking bolton as they sat at council with robb stark, mocking his soft voice and making japes about leeches. he must have been mad. this is no man to jape with. you had only to look at bolton to know that he had more cruelty in his pinky toe than all the freys combined. father. lord ramsay knelt before his sire. lord roose studied him for a moment. you may rise. he turned to help two young women down from inside the wagon. the first was short and very fat, with a round red face and three chins wobbling beneath a sable hood. my new wife, roose bolton said. lady walda, this is my natural son. kiss your stepmother's hand, ramsay. he did. and i am sure you will recall the lady arya. your betrothed. the girl was slim, and taller than he remembered, but that was only to be expected. girls grow fast at that age. her dress was grey wool bordered with white satin; over it she wore an ermine cloak clasped with a silver wolf's head. dark brown hair fell halfway down her back. and her eyes ... that is not lord eddard's daughter. arya had her father's eyes, the grey eyes of the starks. a girl her age might let her hair grow long, add inches to her height, see her chest fill out, but she could not change the color of her eyes. that's sansa's little friend, the steward's girl. jeyne, that was her name. jeyne poole. lord ramsay. the girl dipped down before him. that was wrong as well. the real arya stark would have spat into his face. i pray that i will make you a good wife and give you strong sons to follow after you. that you will, promised ramsay, and soon. he heard the girls first, barking as they raced for home. the drum of hoofbeats echoing off flagstone jerked him to his feet, chains rattling. the one between his ankles was no more than a foot long, shortening his stride to a shuffle. it was hard to move quickly that way, but he tried as best he could, hopping and clanking from his pallet. ramsay bolton had returned and would want his reek on hand to serve him. outside, beneath a cold autumnal sky, the hunters were pouring through the gates. ben bones led the way, with the girls baying and barking all around him. behind came skinner, sour alyn, and damon dance-for-me with his long greased whip, then the walders riding the grey colts lady dustin had given them. his lordship himself rode blood, a red stallion with a temper to match his own. he was laughing. that could be very good or very bad, reek knew. the dogs were on him before he could puzzle out which, drawn to his scent. the dogs were fond of reek; he slept with them oft as not, and sometimes ben bones let him share their supper. the pack raced across the flagstones barking, circling him, jumping up to lick his filthy face, nipping at his legs. helicent caught his left hand between her teeth and worried it so fiercely reek feared he might lose two more fingers. red jeyne slammed into his chest and knocked him off his feet. she was lean, hard muscle, where reek was loose, grey skin and brittle bones, a white-haired starveling. the riders were dismounting by the time he pushed red jeyne off and struggled to his knees. two dozen horsemen had gone out and two dozen had returned, which meant the search had been a failure. that was bad. ramsay did not like the taste of failure. he will want to hurt someone. of late, his lord had been forced to restrain himself, for barrowton was full of men house bolton needed, and ramsay knew to be careful around the dustins and ryswells and his fellow lordlings. with them he was always courteous and smiling. what he was behind closed doors was something else. ramsay bolton was attired as befit the lord of the hornwood and heir to the dreadfort. his mantle was stitched together from wolfskins and clasped against the autumn chill by the yellowed teeth of the wolf's head on his right shoulder. on one hip he wore a falchion, its blade as thick and heavy as a cleaver; on the other a long dagger and a small curved flaying knife with a hooked point and a razor-sharp edge. all three blades had matched hilts of yellow bone. reek, his lordship called down from blood's high saddle, you stink. i can smell you clear across the yard. i know, my lord, reek had to say. i beg your pardon. i brought you a gift. ramsay twisted, reached behind him, pulled something from his saddle, and flung it. catch! between the chain, the fetters, and his missing fingers, reek was clumsier than he had been before he learned his name. the head struck his maimed hands, bounced away from the stumps of his fingers, and landed at his feet, raining maggots. it was so crusted with dried blood as to be unrecognizable. i told you to catch it, said ramsay. pick it up. reek tried to lift the head up by the ear. it was no good. the flesh was green and rotting, and the ear tore off between his fingers. little walder laughed, and a moment later all the other men were laughing too. oh, leave him be, said ramsay. just see to blood. i rode the bastard hard. yes, my lord. i will. reek hurried to the horse, leaving the severed head for the dogs. you smell like pigshit today, reek, said ramsay. on him, that's an improvement, said damon dance-for-me, smiling as he coiled his whip. little walder swung down from the saddle. you can see to my horse too, reek. and to my little i can see to my own horse/' said big walder. little walder had become lord ramsay's best boy and grew more like him every day, but the smaller frey was made of different stuff and seldom took part in his cousin's games and cruelties. reek paid the squires no mind. he led blood off toward the stables, hopping aside when the stallion tried to kick him. the hunters strode into the hall, all but ben bones, who was cursing at the dogs to stop them fighting over the severed head. big walder followed him into the stables, leading his own mount. reek stole a look at him as he removed blood's bit. who was he? he said softly, so the other stablehands would not hear. no one. big walder pulled the saddle off his grey. an old man we met on the road, is all. he was driving an old nanny goat and four kids. his lordship slew him for his goats? his lordship slew him for calling him lord snow. the goats were good, though. we milked the mother and roasted up the kids. lord snow. reek nodded, his chains clinking as he wrestled with blood's saddle straps. by any name, ramsay's no man to be around when he is in a rage. or when he's not. did you find your cousins, my lord? no. i never thought we would. they're dead. lord wyman had them killed. that's what i would have done if i was him. reek said nothing. some things were not safe to say, not even in the stables with his lordship in the hall. one wrong word could cost him another toe, even a finger. not my tongue, though. he will never take my tongue. he likes to hear me plead with him to spare me from the pain. he likes to make me say it. the riders had been sixteen days on the hunt, with only hard bread and salt beef to eat, aside from the occasional stolen kid, so that night lord ramsay commanded that a feast be laid to celebrate his return to barrow-ton. their host, a grizzled one-armed petty lord by the name of harwood stout, knew better than to refuse him, though by now his larders must be well nigh exhausted. reek had heard stout's servants muttering at how the bastard and his men were eating through the winter stores. he'll bed lord eddard's little girl, they say, stout's cook complained when she did not know that reek was listening, but we're the ones who'll be fucked when the snows come, you mark my words. yet lord ramsay had decreed a feast, so feast they must. trestle tables were set up in stout's hall, an ox was slaughtered, and that night as the sun went down the empty-handed hunters ate roasts and ribs, barley bread, a mash of carrots and pease, washing it all down with prodigious quantities of ale. it fell to little walder to keep lord ramsay's cup filled, whilst big walder poured for the others at the high table. reek was chained up beside the doors lest his odor put the feasters off their appetites. he would eat later, off whatever scraps lord ramsay thought to send him. the dogs enjoyed the run of the hall, however, and provided the night's best entertainment, when maude and grey jeyne tore into one of lord stout's hounds over an especially meaty bone that will short had tossed them. reek was the only man in the hall who did not watch the three dogs fight. he kept his eyes on ramsay bolton. the fight did not end until their host's dog was dead. stout's old hound never stood a mummer's chance. he had been one against two, and ramsay's bitches were young, strong, and savage. ben bones, who liked the dogs better than their master, had told reek they were all named after peasant girls ramsay had hunted, raped, and killed back when he'd still been a bastard, running with the first reek. the ones who give him good sport, anywise. the ones who weep and beg and won't run don't get to come back as bitches. the next litter to come out of the dreadfort's kennels would include a kyra, reek did not doubt. he's trained 'em to kill wolves as well, ben bones had confided. reek said nothing. he knew which wolves the girls were meant to kill, but he had no wish to watch the girls fighting over his severed toe. two serving men were carrying off the dead dog's carcass and an old woman had fetched out a mop and rake and bucket to deal with the blood-soaked rushes when the doors to the hall flew open in a wash of wind, and a dozen men in grey mail and iron halfhelms stalked through, shouldering past stout's pasty-faced young guards in their leather brigandines and cloaks of gold and russet. a sudden silence seized the feasters ... all but lord ramsay, who tossed aside the bone he had been gnawing, wiped his mouth on his sleeve, smiled a greasy, wet-lipped smile, and said, father. the lord of the dreadfort glanced idly at the remnants of the feast, at the dead dog, at the hangings on the walls, at reek in his chains and fetters. out, he told the feasters, in a voice as soft as a murmur. now. the lot of you. lord ramsay's men pushed back from the tables, abandoning cups and trenchers. ben bones shouted at the girls, and they trotted after him, some with bones still in their jaws. harwood stout bowed stiffly and relinquished his hall without a word. unchain reek and take him with you, ramsay growled at sour alyn, but his father waved a pale hand and said, no, leave him. even lord roose's own guards retreated, pulling the doors shut behind them. when the echo died away, reek found himself alone in the hall with the two boltons, father and son. you did not find our missing freys. the way roose bolton said it, it was more a statement than a question. we rode back to where lord lamprey claims they parted ways, but the girls could not find a trail. you asked after them in villages and holdfasts. a waste of words. the peasants might as well be blind for all they ever see. ramsay shrugged. does it matter? the world won't miss a few freys. there's plenty more down at the twins should we ever have need of one. lord roose tore a small piece off a heel of bread and ate it. hosteen and aenys are distressed. let them go looking, if they like. lord wyman blames himself. to hear him tell it, he had become especially fond of rhaegar. lord ramsay was turning wroth. reek could see it in his mouth, the curl of those thick lips, the way the cords stood up in his neck. the fools should have stayed with manderly. roose bolton shrugged. lord wyman's litter moves at a snail's pace ... and of course his lordship's health and girth do not permit him to travel more than a few hours a day, with frequent stops for meals. the freys were anxious to reach barrowton and be reunited with their kin. can you blame them for riding on ahead? if that's what they did. do you believe manderly? his father's pale eyes glittered. did i give you that impression? still. his lordship is most distraught. not so distraught that he can't eat. lord pig must have brought half the food in white harbor with him. forty wayns full of foodstuffs. casks of wine and hippocras, barrels of fresh-caught lampreys, a herd of goats, a hundred pigs, crates of crabs and oysters, a monstrous codfish ... lord wyman likes to eat. you may have noticed. what i noticed was that he brought no hostages. i noticed that as well. what do you mean to do about it? it is a quandary. lord roose found an empty cup, wiped it out on the tablecloth, and filled it from a flagon. manderly is not alone in throwing feasts, it would seem. it should have been you who threw the feast, to welcome me back, ramsay complained, and it should have been in barrow hall, not this pisspot of a castle. barrow hall and its kitchens are not mine to dispose of, his father said mildly. i am only a guest there. the castle and the town belong to lady dustin, and she cannot abide you. ramsay's face darkened. if i cut off her teats and feed them to my girls, will she abide me then? will she abide me if i strip off her skin to make myself a pair of boots? unlikely. and those boots would come dear. they would cost us barrowton, house dustin, and the ryswells. roose bolton seated himself across the table from his son. barbrey dustin is my second wife's younger sister, rodrik ryswell's daughter, sister to roger, rickard, and mine own namesake, roose, cousin to the other ryswells. she was fond of my late son and suspects you of having some part in his demise. lady barbrey is a woman who knows how to nurse a grievance. be grateful for that. barrow-ton is staunch for bolton largely because she still holds ned stark to blame for her husband's death. staunch? ramsay seethed. all she does is spit on me. the day will come when i'll set her precious wooden town afire. let her spit on that, see if it puts out the flames. roose made a face, as if the ale he was sipping had suddenly gone sour. there are times you make me wonder if you truly are my seed. my fore-bears were many things, but never fools. no, be quiet now, i have heard enough. we appear strong for the moment, yes. we have powerful friends in the lannisters and freys, and the grudging support of much of the north ... but what do you imagine is going to happen when one of ned stark's sons turns up? ned stark's sons are all dead, reek thought. robb was murdered at the twins, and bran and rickon ... we dipped the heads in tar ... his own head was pounding. he did not want to think about anything that had happened before he knew his name. there were things too hurtful to remember, thoughts almost as painful as ramsay's flaying knife ... stark's little wolflings are dead, said ramsay, sloshing some more ale into his cup, and they'll stay dead. let them show their ugly faces, and my girls will rip those wolves of theirs to pieces. the sooner they turn up, the sooner i kill them again. the elder bolton sighed. again? surely you misspeak. you never slew lord eddard's sons, those two sweet boys we loved so well. that was theon turncloak's work, remember? how many of our grudging friends do you imagine we'd retain if the truth were known? only lady barbrey, whom you would turn into a pair of boots ... inferior boots. human skin is not as tough as cowhide and will not wear as well. by the king's decree you are now a bolton. try and act like one. tales are told of you, ramsay. i hear them everywhere. people fear you. good. you are mistaken. it is not good. no tales were ever told of me. do you think i would be sitting here if it were otherwise? your amusements are your own, i will not chide you on that count, but you must be more discreet. a peaceful land, a quiet people. that has always been my rule. make it yours. is this why you left lady dustin and your fat pig wife? so you could come down here and tell me to be quiet? not at all. there are tidings that you need to hear. lord stannis has finally left the wall. that got ramsay halfway to his feet, a smile glistening on his wide, wet lips. is he marching on the dreadfort? he is not, alas. arnolf does not understand it. he swears that he did all he could to bait the trap. i wonder. scratch a karstark and you'll find a stark. after the scratch the young wolf gave lord rickard, that may be somewhat less true than formerly. be that as it may. lord stannis has taken deepwood motte from the ironmen and restored it to house glover. worse, the mountain clans have joined him, wull and norrey and liddle and the rest. his strength is growing. ours is greater. now it is. now is the time to smash him. let me march on deepwood. after you are wed. ramsay slammed down his cup, and the dregs of his ale erupted across the tablecloth. i'm sick of waiting. we have a girl, we have a tree, and we have lords enough to witness. i'll wed her on the morrow, plant a son between her legs, and march before her maiden's blood has dried. she'll pray for you to march, reek thought, and she'll pray that you never come back to her bed. you will plant a son in her, roose bolton said, but not here. i've decided you shall wed the girl atwinterfell. that prospect did not appear to please lord ramsay. i laid waste to winterfell, or had you forgotten? no, but it appears you have ... the ironmen laid waste to winterfell, and butchered all its people. theon turncloak. ramsay gave reek a suspicious glance. aye, so he did, but still ... a wedding in that ruin? even ruined and broken, winterfell remains lady arya's home. what better place to wed her, bed her, and stake your claim? that is only half of it, however. we would be fools to march on stannis. let stannis march on us. he is too cautious to come to barrowton ... but he must come to winterfell. his clansmen will not abandon the daughter of their precious ned to such as you. stannis must march or lose them ... and being the careful commander that he is, he will summon all his friends and allies when he marches. he will summon arnolf karstark. ramsay licked his chapped lips. and we'll have him. if the gods will it. roose rose to his feet. you'll wed at winterfell. i shall inform the lords that we march in three days and invite them to accompany us. you are the warden of the north. command them. an invitation will accomplish the same thing. power tastes best when sweetened by courtesy. you had best learn that if you ever hope to rule. the lord of the dreadfort glanced at reek. oh, and unchain your pet. i am taking him. taking him? where? he's mine. you cannot have him. roose seemed amused by that. all you have i gave you. you would do well to remember that, bastard. as for this ... reek ... if you have not ruined him beyond redemption, he may yet be of some use to us. get the keys and remove those chains from him, before you make me rue the day i raped your mother. reek saw the way ramsay's mouth twisted, the spittle glistening between his lips. he feared he might leap the table with his dagger in his hand. instead he flushed red, turned his pale eyes from his father's paler ones, and went to find the keys. but as he knelt to unlock the fetters around reek's wrists and ankles, he leaned close and whispered, tell him nothing and remember every word he says. i'll have you back, no matter what that dustin bitch may tell you. who are you? reek, my lord. your man. i'm reek, it rhymes with sneak. it does. when my father brings you back, i'm going to take another finger. i'll let you choose which one. unbidden, tears began to trickle down his cheeks. why? he cried, his voice breaking. i never asked for him to take me from you. i'll do whatever you want, serve, obey, i ... please, no ... ramsay slapped his face. take him, he told his father. he's not even a man. the way he smells disgusts me. the moon was rising over the wooden walls of barrowton when they stepped outside. reek could hear the wind sweeping across the rolling plains beyond the town. it was less than a mile from barrow hall to harwood stout's modest keep beside the eastern gates. lord bolton offered him a horse. can you ride? i... my lord, i... i think so. walton, help him mount. even with the fetters gone, reek moved like an old man. his flesh hung loosely on his bones, and sour alyn and ben bones said he twitched. and his smell ... even the mare they'd brought for him shied away when he tried to mount. she was a gentle horse, though, and she knew the way to barrow hall. lord bolton fell in beside him as they rode out the gate. the guards fell back to a discreet distance. what would you have me call you? the lord asked, as they trotted down the broad straight streets of barrowton. reek, i'm reek, it rhymes with wreak. reek, he said, if it please my lord. m'lord. bolton's lips parted just enough to show a quarter inch of teeth. it might have been a smile. he did not understand. my lord? i said— —my lord, when you should have said m'lord. your tongue betrays your birth with every word you say. if you want to sound a proper peasant, say it as if you had mud in your mouth, or were too stupid to realize it was two words, not just one. if it please my— m'lord. better. your stench is quite appalling. yes, m'lord. i beg your pardon, m'lord. why? the way you smell is my son's doing, not your own. i am well aware of that. they rode past a stable and a shuttered inn with a wheat sheaf painted on its sign. reek heard music coming through its windows. i knew the first reek. he stank, though not for want of washing. i have never known a cleaner creature, truth be told. he bathed thrice a day and wore flowers in his hair as if he were a maiden. once, when my second wife was still alive, he was caught stealing scent from her bedchamber. i had him whipped for that, a dozen lashes. even his blood smelled wrong. the next year he tried it again. this time he drank the perfume and almost died of it. it made no matter. the smell was something he was born with. a curse, the smallfolk said. the gods had made him stink so that men would know his soul was rotting. my old maester insisted it was a sign of sickness, yet the boy was otherwise as strong as a young bull. no one could stand to be near him, so he slept with the pigs ... until the day that ramsay's mother appeared at my gates to demand that i provide a servant for my bastard, who was growing up wild and unruly. i gave her reek. it was meant to be amusing, but he and ramsay became inseparable. i do wonder, though ... was it ramsay who corrupted reek, or reek ramsay? his lordship glanced at the new reek with eyes as pale and strange as two white moons. what was he whispering whilst he un-chained you? he ... he said ... he said to tell you nothing. the words caught in his throat, and he began to cough and choke. breathe deep. i know what he said. you're to spy on me and keep his secrets. bolton chuckled. as if he had secrets. sour alyn, luton, skinner, and the rest, where does he think they came from? can he truly believe they are his men? his men, reek echoed. some comment seemed to be expected of him, but he did not know what to say. has my bastard ever told you how i got him? that he did know, to his relief. yes, my ... m'lord. you met his mother whilst out riding and were smitten by her beauty. smitten? bolton laughed. did he use that word? why, the boy has a singer's soul ... though if you believe that song, you may well be dimmer than the first reek. even the riding part is wrong. i was hunting a fox along the weeping water when i chanced upon a mill and saw a young woman washing clothes in the stream. the old miller had gotten himself a new young wife, a girl not half his age. she was a tall, willowy creature, very healthy-\ook\ng. long legs and small firm breasts, like two ripe plums. pretty, in a common sort of way. the moment that i set eyes on her i wanted her. such was my due. the maesters will tell you that king jaehaerys abolished the lord's right to the first night to appease his shrewish queen, but where the old gods rule, old customs linger. the umbers keep the first night too, deny it as they may. certain of the mountain clans as well, and on skagos ... well, only heart trees ever see half of what they do on skagos. this miller's marriage had been performed without my leave or knowledge. the man had cheated me. so i had him hanged, and claimed my rights beneath the tree where he was swaying. if truth be told, the wench was hardly worth the rope. the fox escaped as well, and on our way back to the dreadfort my favorite courser came up lame, so all in all it was a dismal day. a year later this same wench had the impudence to turn up at the dreadfort with a squalling, red-faced monster that she claimed was my own get. i should've had the mother whipped and thrown her child down a well ... but the babe did have my eyes. she told me that when her dead husband's brother saw those eyes, he beat her bloody and drove her from the mill. that annoyed me, so i gave her the mill and had the brother's tongue cut out, to make certain he did not go running to winterfell with tales that might disturb lord rickard. each year i sent the woman some piglets and chickens and a bag of stars, on the understanding that she was never to tell the boy who had fathered him. a peaceful land, a quiet people, that has always been my rule. a fine rule, m'lord. the woman disobeyed me, though. you see what ramsay is. she made him, her and reek, always whispering in his ear about his rights. he should have been content to grind corn. does he truly think that he can ever rule the north? he fights for you, reek blurted out. he's strong. bulls are strong. bears. i have seen my bastard fight. he is not entirely to blame. reek was his tutor, the first reek, and reek was never trained at arms. ramsay is ferocious, i will grant you, but he swings that sword like a butcher hacking meat. he's not afraid of anyone, m'lord. he should be. fear is what keeps a man alive in this world of treachery and deceit. even here in barrowton the crows are circling, waiting to feast upon our flesh. the cerwyns and the tallharts are not to be relied on, my fat friend lord wyman plots betrayal, and whoresbane ... the umbers may seem simple, but they are not without a certain low cunning. ramsay should fear them all, as i do. the next time you see him, tell him that. tell him ... tell him to be afraid? reek felt ill at the very thought of it. m'lord, i ... if i did that, he'd i know. lord bolton sighed. his blood is bad. he needs to be leeched. the leeches suck away the bad blood, all the rage and pain. no man can think so full of anger. ramsay, though ... his tainted blood would poison even leeches, i fear. he is your only son. for the moment. i had another, once. domeric. a quiet boy, but most accomplished. he served four years as lady dustin's page, and three in the vale as a squire to lord redfort. he played the high harp, read histories, and rode like the wind. horses ... the boy was mad for horses, lady dustin will tell you. not even lord rickard's daughter could outrace him, and that one was half a horse herself. redfort said he showed great promise in the lists. a great jouster must be a great horseman first. yes, m'lord. domeric. i ... i have heard his name ... ramsay killed him. a sickness of the bowels, maester uthor says, but i say poison. in the vale, domeric had enjoyed the company of redfort's sons. he wanted a brother by his side, so he rode up the weeping water to seek my bastard out. i forbade it, but domeric was a man grown and thought that he knew better than his father. now his bones lie beneath the dreadfort with the bones of his brothers, who died still in the cradle, and i am left with ramsay. tell me, my lord ... if the kinslayer is accursed, what is a father to do when one son slays another? the question frightened him. once he had heard skinner say that the bastard had killed his trueborn brother, but he had never dared to believe it. he could be wrong. brothers die sometimes, it does not mean that they were killed. my brothers died, and i never killed them. my lord has a new wife to give him sons. and won't my bastard love that? lady walda is a frey, and she has a fertile feel to her. i have become oddly fond of my fat little wife. the two before her never made a sound in bed, but this one squeals and shudders. i find that quite endearing. if she pops out sons the way she pops in tarts, the dreadfort will soon be overrun with boltons. ramsay will kill them all, of course. that's for the best. i will not live long enough to see new sons to manhood, and boy lords are the bane of any house. walda will grieve to see them die, though. reek's throat was dry. he could hear the wind rattling the bare branches of the elms that lined the street. my lord, i— m'lord, remember? m'lord. if i might ask ... why did you want me? i'm no use to anyone, i'm not even a man, i'm broken, and ... the smell ... a bath and change of clothes will make you smell sweeter. a bath? reek felt a clenching in his guts. i ... i would sooner not, m'lord. please. i have ... wounds, i ... and these clothes, lord ramsay gave them to me, he ... he said that i was never to take them off, save at his command ... you are wearing rags, lord bolton said, quite patiently. filthy things, torn and stained and stinking of blood and urine. and thin. you must be cold. we'll put you in lambswool, soft and warm. perhaps a fur-lined cloak. would you like that? no. he could not let them take the clothes lord ramsay gave him. he could not let them see him. would you prefer to dress in silk and velvet? there was a time when you were fond of such, i do recall. no, he insisted, shrilly. no, i only want these clothes. reek's clothes. i'm reek, it rhymes with peek. his heart was beating like a drum, and his voice rose to a frightened squeak. i don't want a bath. please, m'lord, don't take my clothes. will you let us wash them, at least? no. no, m'lord. please. he clutched his tunic to his chest with both hands and hunched down in the saddle, half-afraid that roose bolton might command his guardsmen to tear the clothes off him right there in the street. as you wish. bolton's pale eyes looked empty in the moonlight, as if there were no one behind them at all. i mean you no harm, you know. i owe you much and more. you do? some part of him was screaming, this is a trap, he is playing with you, the son is just the shadow of the father. lord ramsay played with his hopes all the time. what ... what do you owe me, m'lord? the north. the starks were done and doomed the night that you took winterfell. he waved a pale hand, dismissive. all this is only squabbling over spoils. their short journey reached its end at the wooden walls of barrow hall. banners flew from its square towers, flapping in the wind: the flayed man of the dreadfort, the battle-axe of cerwyn, tallhart's pines, the merman of manderly, old lord locke's crossed keys, the umber giant and the stony hand of flint, the hornwood moose. for the stouts, chevrony russet and gold, for slate, a grey field within a double tressure white. four horseheads proclaimed the four ryswells of the rills— one grey, one black, one gold, one brown. the jape was that the ryswells could not even agree upon the color of their arms. above them streamed the stag-and-lion of the boy who sat upon the iron throne a thousand leagues away. reek listened to the vanes turning on the old windmill as they rode beneath the gatehouse into a grassy courtyard where stableboys ran out to take their horses. this way, if you please. lord bolton led him toward the keep, where the banners were those of the late lord dustin and his widowed wife. his showed a spiked crown above crossed longaxes; hers quartered those same arms with rodrik ryswell's golden horsehead. as he climbed a wide flight of wooden steps to the hall, reek's legs began to shake. he had to stop to steady them, staring up at the grassy slopes of the great barrow. some claimed it was the grave of the first king, who had led the first men to westerns. others argued that it must be some king of the giants who was buried there, to account for its size. a few had even been known to say it was no barrow, just a hill, but if so it was a lonely hill, for most of the barrowlands were flat and windswept. inside the hall, a woman stood beside the hearth, warming thin hands above the embers of a dying fire. she was clad all in black, from head to heel, and wore no gold nor gems, but she was highborn, that was plain to see. though there were wrinkles at the corners of her mouth and more around her eyes, she still stood tall, unbent, and handsome. her hair was brown and grey in equal parts and she wore it tied behind her head in a widow's knot. who is this? she said. where is the boy? did your bastard refuse to give him up? is this old man his ... oh, gods be good, what is that smell? has this creature soiled himself? he has been with ramsay. lady barbrey, allow me to present the rightful lord of the iron islands, theon of house greyjoy. me. no, he thought, no, don't say that name, ramsay will hear you, he'll know, he'll know, he'll hurt her mouth pursed. he is not what i expected. he is what we have. what did your bastard do to him? removed some skin, i would imagine. a few small parts. nothing too essential. is he mad? he may be. does it matter? reek could hear no more. please, m'lord, m'lady, there's been some mistake. he fell to his knees, trembling like a leaf in a winter storm, tears streaming down his ravaged cheeks. i'm not him, i'm not the turncloak, he died at winterfell. my name is reek. he had to remember his name. it rhymes with freak.
